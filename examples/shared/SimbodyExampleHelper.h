/* This class contains utility methods that can be helpful for Simbody
example programs. In particular it knows the search path to be used to find
auxiliary and shared files needed by particular examples.

We depend on two macros being defined at compile time:
    SIMBODY_EXAMPLE_NAME
        the example name is also the subdirectory name for auxilary files
        for that example
    SIMBODY_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_SRC
        this is the directory into which Simbody example source was installed

The Simbody example CMakeList.txt will define these macros when building
Simbody.
