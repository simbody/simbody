# Build and install examples.
#
# This is for use when building Simbody from source; it is not for
# end users to build examples themselves. This guarantees that the 
# examples built with Simbody are using the libraries just built regardless
# of what is installed. We install a different CMakeLists.txt along with
# the examples for end users to use.
#
# Examples are built from an explicit list of subdirectories given below,
# and then simpler examples are built one per .cpp file in the top level
# examples directory. If your example needs more than just a single .cpp,
# put it in its own subdirectory where it can have its own CMakeLists.txt.
#
# Note that unlike code in the "tests" directory (but like the 
# "tests/adhoc" code), this does not generate CMake ADD_TEST commands so 
# these will never run automatically.
#
# For IDEs that can deal with PROJECT_LABEL properties (at least
# Visual Studio) the projects for building each of these adhoc
# executables will be labeled "Example - TheExampleName" if a file
# TheExampleName.cpp is found in this directory, or if we build from 
# a subdirectory called TheExampleName.
#
# We check the BUILD_TESTS_AND_EXAMPLES_{SHARED,STATIC} variables to 
# determine whether to build dynamically linked, statically linked, or both
# versions of the executable.
