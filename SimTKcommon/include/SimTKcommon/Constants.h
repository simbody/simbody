/**@file
High precision mathematical and physical constants. This file is self-contained
and can be included in ANSI C programs as well as C++.**/

/** @defgroup PredefinedConstants      Predefined Constants

There are two kinds of numerical constants predefined by %SimTK: (1) a set
of typed, const, in-memory values in the SimTK namespace, at the default Real
precision or with other specific types, and (2) a set of preprocessor
(\#define) macros containing extremely high-precision precalculated numerical
values in long double precision.

You should use the typed constants whenever possible in your code since they
are very compact and well-behaved in C++. They have memory addresses so can
be returned as references. Because they are filled in at startup, they can
include machine- and precision-specific values like NaN, Infinity, machine
roundoff error, number of digits in a float, etc. that are very useful for
writing robust, precision-independent numerical algorithms.

The macro values must be cast to the appropriate type before use, and are
mostly useful as raw material for making \e typed constants. These macros
contain <em>machine-independent</em> constants, including unitless mathematical
constants like pi, as well as physical constants and unit conversion factors.
These constants are provided at extremely high precision as compile-time
macros in long double precision. By using very high precision we ensure
sufficient accuracy for any IEEE long double precision implementation (they
can be 64, 80, or 128 bits). These constants can be used as raw material for
providing nicer templatized constants in appropriate precisions and unit
systems.

<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
Note that the %SimTK convention for typed constants is to name them
like ordinary variables except with an initial capital letter (like a
class name). This is distinct from the widely-used convention for
constants that are defined via the presprocessor as macros (that is,
using \#define). Those are written entirely in
\c UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, after an initial \c SimTK_. Typed constants
are processed instead by the compiler itself and do not require any
special treatment when used; they behave just like variables of the
same type and value would behave so there is no need to shout when
using them. **/

/** @defgroup MacroConstants      Preprocessor Macro Constants
    @ingroup  PredefinedConstants

These are preprocessor (\#define) macros providing constants values at very
high precision.\ See the discussion under the main \ref PredefinedConstants
module heading.

<h2>Units</h2>
Our most common unit systems are the "SI" (MKS) system, and the "MD" system
used for molecular dynamics. SI units are meters, kg, seconds, coulombs
(ampere-s), kelvins and moles. MD units are nanometers, atomic mass units
(Daltons, g/mol), picoseconds, proton charge e, kelvins, and moles. Many
molecular dynamicists and chemists prefer kcals for energy and angstroms for
length. This does not constitute a consistent set of units, however, so
we provide for it by conversion from the MD units, which are consistent.
(By consistent, we mean that force units = mass-length/time^2, so f=ma!)

force      N (kg-m/s^2)    kJ/(mol-nm) = TN/mol      kcal/(mol-A)
                             (Da-nm/ps^2) (T=10^12)    (418.4 Da-A/ps^2)

</pre>

We always keep angles in radians internally, which are unitless. However,
most humans prefer degrees where 1 degree = Pi/180 radians so we provide
convenient conversions. **/

/** @defgroup MathConstants          Mathematical Constants
    @ingroup  MacroConstants

These are some common unitless numerical constants evaluated to 64 digits and
written here in maximal (long double) precision. (These values were generated
using the symbolic calculator Maple which is part of Matlab's Symbolic
Toolbox.) These can be cast to lower precisions when needed, and can be used
in compile-time constant expressions like 2*SimTK_PI or 1/SimTK_SQRT2 for which
the compiler will properly calculate a long double result with no runtime cost.

These constants are also available as type-safe, already-rounded,
precision-templatized values with static memory addresses as part of our scalar
system (see NTraits<T>). You should use the templatized versions when possible.
The templatized versions also contain more elaborate constants such as NaN,
Infinity, and "epsilon" (machine precision) which can only be generated for
specific types. **/

These constants are from the CODATA 2002 set from the NIST Physics Laboratory
web site http://physics.nist.gov/constants (NIST SP 961 Dec 2005).
Ref: P.J. Mohr and B.N. Taylor, Rev. Mod. Phys. 77(1) (2005).

@par Uncertainty
Uncertainties are given in the CODATA set as the one-std-deviation uncertainty
in the last 2 digits of the given value. That means that there is about a 68%
chance that the last two digits are as shown +/- the uncertainty.

How to combine uncertainties (extracted from
http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Uncertainty/combination.html):
Assume measured quantities are x1, y1 with u1=uncertainty(x1),
u2=uncertainty(x2). We want to combine them into a new quantity y and calculate
u=uncertainty(y).
<pre>
    Addition rule: y    = a1*x1 + a2*x2 for factors a1,a2.
     then          u^2  = a1*u1^2 + a2*u2^2
    Multiplication rule y = a*x1^e1*x2^e2 for factor a and exponents e1,e2.
    Let ur1=u1/|x1|, ur2=u2/|x2| be the relative uncertainties, ur is u/|y|.
     then          ur^2 = e1^2*ur1^2 + e2^2*ur2^2, u = ur*|y|
