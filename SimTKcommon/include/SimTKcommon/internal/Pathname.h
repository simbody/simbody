/**
 * This class encapsulates the handling of file and directory pathnames
 * in a platform-independent manner. We consider a pathname to consist
 * of three components:
 * <pre> [directory] [filename [extension]] </pre>
 * where the directory may be an absolute location or relative to a
 * current working directory or specified working directory.
 *
 * Several special directory names are supported here:
 *  - root (/)
 *  - current working directory (.)
 *  - current executable directory (@)
 *  - platform default installation directory
 *  - parent directory (..)
 *
 * On Windows root and current working directory are drive-specific, referring
 * to the current drive if none is specified. The current executable
 * directory is the absolute directory name containing the executable
 * program which is currently running.
 *
 * A pathname has "segments" which are separated by either forward
 * slashes or backslashes. We are relaxed about the slashes and will
 * accept either one and pathnames which use both. However, each operating
 * system platform has a preferred separator character, backslash on
 * Windows and forward slash everywhere else and we will clean up
 * returned pathnames to use exclusively the preferred separator for
 * the current platform.
 *
 * Pathnames that end in an empty segment, or a segment consisting of
 * just "." or ".." are directory path names, meaning that the "filename"
 * and "extension" components are empty. Other pathnames may be directories
 * or filenames depending on context. Whenever we generate a pathname that
 * we know to be a directory, it will end in a final slash.
 *
 * There is also the concept of a "drive" which on Windows is a drive
 * letter followed by a colon (e.g. "c:") but is always the empty string
 * on non-Windows platforms. The drive, if present is considered part of
 * the directory and does not affect whether the directory is considered
 * relative or absolute. Drive designators are recognized only on Windows;
 * they are just considered ordinary pathname characters on other platforms.
 *
 * This class is useful for generating "canonicalized" pathnames from
 * names that have been pieced together from environment variables and
 * user entry. Canonicalized names are always absolute pathnames; they
 * contain no empty, ".", or ".." segments. On Windows a canonicalized
 * name is always prefixed by an explicit disk designator followed by
 * a backslash; on other platforms the canonicalized name will always
 * begin with a forward slash.
 *
 * @bug Eliminating ".." segments textually can cause them to behave incorrectly
 *      in the presence of symbolic links. These should probably be left in
 *      place with evaluation deferred.

    ///   the root directory (this drive's root for Windows).
    /// - "." starts an absolute path name which is relative to the

    /// as separate strings with separators included such that concatenating
    /// all the strings reproduces the pathname in a canonicalized form.

    /// characters. Note that we include the drive letter as part of the

    /// - If the swd is empty (after removing whitespace), deconstructPathname()
    ///   is called, and cwd is prepended if needed to make it an absolute path.

    ///      (e.g. /usr/file.ext or c:/documents/file.ext), then swd is ignored, and the

    ///      (e.g. "./dir/file.ext" or "dir/file.ext"), then the swd is prepended to path.
