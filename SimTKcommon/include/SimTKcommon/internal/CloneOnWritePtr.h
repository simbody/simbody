/** Smart pointer with deep copy semantics but with the copying delayed until
an attempt is made to write on the contained object. 

This is like `std::shared_ptr` when an object is being read, but like 
SimTK::ClonePtr when the object is written. Like SimTK::ClonePtr, 
%CloneOnWritePtr supports copy and assigment operations, by insisting that the 
contained object have a `clone()` method that returns a pointer to a 
heap-allocated deep copy of the *concrete* object. The API is modeled as closely
as possible to the C++11 `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`. The get() 
method is modified to return a const pointer to avoid accidental copying, with 
upd() (update) added to return a writable pointer.

This class is entirely inline and has no computational or space overhead
beyond the cost of dealing with the reference count, except when a copy has
to be made due to a write attempt.

@tparam T   The type of the contained object, which *must* have a `clone()` 
            method. May be an abstract or concrete type.
