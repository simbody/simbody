/** Wrap a pointer to an abstract base class in a way that makes it behave like
a concrete class. This is similar to std::unique_ptr in that it does not permit
shared ownership of the object. However, unlike std::unique_ptr, %ClonePtr
supports copy and assigment operations, by insisting that the contained object
have a clone() method that returns a pointer to a heap-allocated deep copy of
the <em>concrete</em> object.

We define operator==() and operator<() here that delegate to the contained
object; if you want to use those the contained type must support that
operator.

This class is entirely inline and has no computational or space overhead; it
contains just a single pointer and does no reference counting.
