/**
 * This class is used for performing multithreaded computations.  To use it,
 * define a subclass of ParallelExecutor::Task that performs some computation.
 * Then create a ParallelExecutor object and ask it to execute the task:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ParallelExecutor executor;
 * executor.execute(myTask, times);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The Task's execute() method will be called the specified number of times,
 * with each invocation being given a different index value from 0 to times-1.
 * The invocations are done in parallel on multiple threads, so you cannot make
 * any assumptions about what order they will occur in or which ones will
 * happen at the same time.
 * 
 * The threads are created in the ParallelExecutor's constructor and remain
 * active until it is deleted. This means that creating a ParallelExecutor is a
 * somewhat expensive operation, but it may then be used repeatedly for
 * executing various calculations.  By default, the number of threads is chosen
 * to be equal to the number of available processor cores.  You can optionally
 * specify a different number of threads to create.  For example, using more
 * threads than processors can sometimes lead to better processor
 * utilitization.  Alternatively, if the Task will only be executed four times,
 * you might specify min(4, ParallelExecutor::getNumProcessors()) to avoid
 * creating extra threads that will never have any work to do.
 *
 * You may find it useful to use "thread local" variables with your parallel
 * tasks. A thread local variable may have a different value on each thread
 * Thread-local storage is useful in many situations when writing multithreaded
 * code. For example, it can be used as temporary workspace for calculations.
 * If a single workspace object were created, all access to it would need to be
 * synchronized to prevent threads from overwriting each other's values. Making
 * a variable `thread_local T` means that a separate workspace object of type
 * `T` will automatically be created for each thread. That object will have
 * "thread scope" meaning it will be destructed only on thread termination.
 * 
 * One way to use thread local variables is to declare a static thread local
 * member variable in your ParallelExecutor::Task:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * class MyTask : public ParallelExecutor::Task {
 *     ...
 * public:
 *     void execute(int index) override {
 *         workspace += 1.0; // incremented separately on each thread.
 *     }
 * private:
 *     static thread_local double workspace;
 * };
 * // Initialize the static variable out-of-line.
 * thread_local double workspace = 0;
 * @endcode
