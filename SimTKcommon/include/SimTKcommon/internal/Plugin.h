/**
 * This is the base class for representing a runtime-linked dynamic library,
 * also known as a "plugin", in a platform-independent manner. For any particular
 * kind of plugin, derive a concrete class from this one and use the macros
 * to describe the functions or data you expect to find there. Then each
 * plugin library you load of that type is an object of the concrete class
 * you defined. The derived class constructor sets the search policy for
 * plugin libraries of that type. For example:
 * <pre>
 * class MyPlugin : public Plugin {
 * public:
 *     explicit MyPlugin() : Plugin() {
 *         addSearchDirectory(Pathname::getInstallDir("SimTK_INSTALL_DIR", "SimTK")
 *                             + "/lib/plugins/");
 *     }
 *
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION1(int,exportedFunctionWithOneArg,const std::string&);
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION(SomeObjectType*,anExportedFunctionNoArgs);
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION(void, someFunction);
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_SYMBOL(SymbolType, nameOfExportedSymbol);
 * };
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then this class is used as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     MyPlugin lib1;
 *     if (!lib1.load("libraryName")) {
 *         std::cerr << lib1.getLastErrorMessage() << std::endl;
 *         // exit, retry or whatever
 *     }
 *     // At this point you can call the functions and access
 *     // the symbols, e.g.
 *     int i = lib1.exportedFunctionWithOneArg("hi");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The currently available macros are:
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_SYMBOL(type, name)
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION(returnType, name)
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION1(returnType, name, typeOfArg)
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION2(returnType, name, typeOfArg1, typeOfArg2)
 *
 * These define methods in the derived class which can obtain the symbol
 * address from the plugin library as needed. The methods will have the
 * same signature as the library's exported function. In the case of the
 * symbol, a no-argument method named the same as the symbol will be
 * created. For example,
 * <pre> SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_SYMBOL(int, myCounter); </pre>
 * says the library contains an exported external symbol of type int
 * named "myCounter". If the Plugin object is "plugin" then you can
 * access this symbol (read only) as
 * <pre> const int& counter = plugin.myCounter(); </pre>
 * The macros also define another method of the same name as the symbol
 * or function, but prepended with "has_". This returns true if the
 * named object is exported by the library, otherwise false. If you try
 * to access a method or symbol without checking first, an exception
 * will be thrown if the library doesn't export the symbol.
