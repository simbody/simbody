/**@file

 * The definitions associated with these template method declarations are

 *
 * SimTK Core client-side headers include this declarations file in order to

/**
 * This class provides some infrastructure useful in making SimTK Private
 * Implementation (PIMPL) classes. These consist of a "handle" class and
 * an "implementation" class. The handle contains only a single pointer,
 * which points to the implementation class whose definition is unknown
 * to the SimTK client. The implementation class has a pointer back to
 * *one* of the handles that points to it -- that one is called the "owner
 * handle" and is the only one which will delete the implementation object
 * when the handle is deleted or goes out of scope. All other handles are
 * merely references to the implementation object, and must not be used
 * after the owner handle is deleted.
 *
 * The methods defined below require a definition for the implementation
 * class, so can't be instantiated on the client side. Instead they are
 * instantiated on the library side when needed in the implementation of
 * the PIMPL handle class derived from the PIMPLHandle base.
 *
 * By the time of instantiation, we must have a definition for the IMPL
 * class supplied to the templatized base class. We expect that the IMPL
 * class will be derived from PIMPLImplementation declared below. We
 * also expect to find certain methods defined, with these names and
 * meanings:
 *
 *     IMPL* IMPL::clone() const
 *        This creates an implementation object identical to the one
 *        we have, except that its owner handle is set to null. We
 *        expect the owner handle to be filled in by the derived
 *        Handle class, which should have initiated the PIMPLHandle
 *        operation which had the need to clone().
 *
 *     const HANDLE& IMPL::getOwnerHandle() const
 *        If the IMPL object does not have an owner, this is expected
 *        to assert(); that would indicate that the derived Handle class
 *        did not properly register itself as the owner upon construction.
 *        Otherwise, this routine returns a reference to the *derived*
 *        Handle class, NOT to the PIMPLHandle parent class! We expect,
 *        however that the Handle class was derived from this PIMPLHandle
 *        so that we can static_cast up here and then compare with 'this'.
 *
 * Usage:
 *    class MySecretImpl;
 *    class MyHandle : public PIMPLHandle<MyHandle,MySecretImpl>
 *
 * There is an optional third template argument, a bool, which can be
 * set true if you want the handle to have pointer semantics rather than
 * the usual object ("value") semantics. Pointer semantics objects
 * have shallow copy constuctor and copy assignment implementations so
 * that they are normally references to objects rather than owners,
 * and pointer semantics owner handles can't be the target of an
 * assignment.

/**
 * This class provides some infrastructure useful in creating PIMPL
 * Implementation classes (the ones referred to by Handles). Note that
 * this class is used by SimTK Core code ONLY on the library side; it never
 * appears in headers intended for use by clients. However it is
 * generally useful enough that we include it here to assist people
 * who would like to make their own PIMPL classes. Consequently, there
 * are no binary compatibility issues raised by the exposure of data
 * members here, and no guarantees that they won't change from release to
 * relase of the SimTK Core; if the definition should change at some point
 * the library code will change but it will be using the updated definition
 * and does not have to coordinate in any way with client code.
 *
 * Other users of this class should be aware that if you include it in
 * code you expose to your own users you may create binary compatibility
 * problems for yourself. Better to restrict use of this class (and indeed
 * inclusion of this header file) to your private ".cpp" source code and
 * not in your API header files.
 *
 * The PIMPLImplementation base class keeps track of how many Handles
 * are referencing it, so that that the last handle to be deleted can
 * delete the implementation. One handle is designated as the "owner"
 * handle of this implementation. We keep a pointer to that handle here,
 * so special handling is required if the owner handle is deleted while
 * other references still exist.
