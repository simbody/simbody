/**@file

clock_getttime() and nanosleep(), and also provides some convenient methods
for use in common timing situations. **/

/**@defgroup TimingFunctions Timing Functions
   @ingroup GlobalFunctions

These functions provide a convenient way to do high-precision timing, either
for real time use or performance measurement, and to sleep for precise time
intervals. Both elapsed and CPU timing is supported, with the latter on a
per-process or per-thread basis. Times are measured using a double precision
floating point number of seconds, which is usually the most convenient form.
Alternatives are available that measure time as a 64 bit integer count of
nanosecond ticks, providing the highest resolution and consistency for very
short measurements.

Note that you can also use the Posix functions clock_gettime() and nanosleep()
on any SimTK-supported platform, as well as usleep() (time in microseconds)
although Posix considers that obsolete.

On Linux systems, use of these timing functions requires linking with the
librt realtime library (-lrt). **/

/** @defgroup TimeConversions Timespec/Nanosecond/Second Conversions
    @ingroup TimingFunctions

These inline functions provide a fast and convenient way for doing arithmetic
with the ugly Posix timespec struct. Use them to convert the timespec to
a long long integer number of nanoseconds, do arithmetic in that form, and
then convert back. Negative times are handled correctly (they come up as
the result of subtraction and comparisons).

We usually prefer to deal with times as a double precision floating point
number of seconds and functions are provided for converting between
nanoseconds and seconds in this format.

@par Cautions:
    - For long intervals the precision of time in seconds will necessarily be
      less than the precision of the nanosecond count, since IEEE double
      precision has a 53 bit mantissa, while 63 bits are available for the count.
    - A signed long long integer containing a count of nanosecond ticks
      is limited to time intervals of about +/- 292 years, which is
      substantially less than can be contained in a timespec, but is plenty
      for interval timing.

These functions provide measurement of CPU time consumed by a process or

and is reported as a double precision floating point value in seconds.

10-50ms range depending on the particulars of your system. That means you
won't get repeatable results unless you measure substantial amounts of
CPU time; don't expect to get meaningful information measuring CPU times
of less than a second or so. **/

/** @defgroup ElapsedTime High-Resolution Elapsed Time Measurement and Sleep
    @ingroup TimingFunctions

These functions provide access to the system's high resolution interval timer,
and highest precision sleep facility for unscheduling a thread until it is
needed at a specific later time. The interval timer measures elapsed time from
some arbitrary starting point (typically since the system was last booted). It
is expected that this timer provides very precise measurement of short time
intervals, but cannot be depended upon to measure very long periods without
drifting. That is, it may not be synchronized to the system time of day.

Generally it is most convenient to measure intervals as a floating point number
of seconds, however this provides a variable amount of precision as the
absolute value of the timer increases. For maximum precision, you can obtain
the timer value as an integer number of nanoseconds instead. You can improve
accuracy by subtacting the integer counts first before converting to seconds.
The actual resolution is system-dependent, but it should be able to accurately
measure elapsed times of 1ms or less, substantially less on some systems. **/
