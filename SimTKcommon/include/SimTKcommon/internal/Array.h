/** This templatized type is used by the Array_<T,X> classes to obtain the
information they need to use the class X as an index class for the array.
There must be a specialization here providing ArrayIndexTraits for each of
the built-in integral types that is suitable for use as an index. Any other
type X will qualify as an index if it defines the following members:

  - typedef size_type
  - typedef difference_type
  - static size_type max_size()
  - operator size_type() const (conversion from X to size_type)

max_size() determines the largest number of elements that a container may hold
if its index type is X.

size_type must be an integral type large enough to hold
all the values from 0 to max_size(), including all the index values (which
range from 0 to max_size()-1). size_type may be signed or unsigned; it is the
type returned by size(), max_size(), capacity(), etc. and may be compared
directly against an index of type X without producing a compiler warning.

difference_type is a signed integral type that can hold all possible
differences between two indices, that is, values between -(max_size()-1) and
+(max_size()-1). In most cases we use an integral type with the same number of
bits for size_type and difference_type but when the index type is very small
(bool, unsigned char, or unsigned short) we want to allow the full range (2,
255, or 65535 elements, resp.) in which case we need a wider type to hold the
differences.

The conversion operator ensures that we can write size_type(i) for an index
i of type X. An explicit conversion member does not need to be present as long
as the conversion size_type(i) already works as it does for all the integral
type specializations.

The SimTK type-generating macro SimTK_DEFINE_UNIQUE_INDEX_TYPE() provides the
necessary members so that these types can be used directly as index types for
Array_ objects with no further preparation. For example, you can make an
Array_<int,MobilizedBodyIndex> that stores ints that can be indexed only via
MobilizedBodyIndex indices.

/** This Array_ helper class is the base class for ArrayView_ which is the
base class for Array_; here we provide only the minimal read-only "const"
functionality required by any Array_ object, and shallow copy semantics. The
ability to write is added by the ArrayView_ class, and the additional ability
to reallocate, insert, erase, etc. is added by the Array_ class.

This class is particularly useful for recasting existing const data into a
const Array_ without copying. For example a const std::vector can be passed
to a const Array& argument by an implicit, near-zero cost conversion to an
ArrayViewConst_ which can then convert to a const Array&.

An ArrayViewConst_ is given all the data it is going to have at the time it is
constructed (except when it is being accessed from the derived Array_ class
that has more capability). The contents and size of a ArrayViewConst_ cannot be
changed after construction. In particular, the default copy assignment operator
is suppressed. The destructor simply disconnects the ArrayViewConst_ handle
from the data it was referencing; no element destruction or heap deallocation
occurs.

//==============================================================================
/** The Array_<T> container class is a plug-compatible replacement for
the C++ standard template library (STL) std::vector<T> class, but with some
important advantages in performance, and functionality, and binary
compatibility.

@tparam T
    The type of object to be stored in this container.
@tparam X
    The type to be used for indexing this container, with default unsigned
    (not size_t). Any integral type may be used, as well as user types that
    satisfy the requirements discussed with class ArrayIndexTraits.

@par Performance:
There are several performance and memory footprint problems with the C++
standard STL design in general, and with Microsoft's implementation in
particular, that are addressed here. Microsoft in its wisdom decided that STL
containers should still do runtime range checks in Release builds for safety,
but that makes them too slow for use in some high-performance contexts (and
also breaks the promise of generic programming but that's another rant). In
practice, VC++12 (2013) std::vector runs about half speed for simple operations
like indexing and push_back (see Simbody's TestArray regression test for an
executable performance comparison). Attempting to disable these runtime checks
with `_SECURE_SCL` breaks binary compatibility with other code built with the
same compiler but without the flag. In contrast the performance of this
Array_<T> class on any platform is indistinguishable from what you would
get by managing your own heap-allocated arrays. 64 bit compilers vary on how
well they handle 32 bit integers though, so in some cases the default index
type (32 bit unsigned) won't be as fast as if you use a 64 bit unsigned type
as does std::vector.

@par
Regarding memory footprint, the typical implementation of std::vector uses
three pointers: 12 bytes for 32 bit machines; 24 bytes for 64 bit machines.
Microsoft somehow manages to trump this with 20 to 24 bytes on a 32 bit
machine (last checked in VC++9); they are at 24 bytes for 64 bit Release builds
in VC++12, 32 bytes in Debug builds. Array_ instead uses one pointer and two
lengths for a total size as little as 8 bytes on 32 bits and 16 on 64 bits;
see below for details. The binary representation for Array_ is the same in
Release and Debug builds.

@par
Some nuts and bolts:

- We promise that no heap allocation occurs when an empty Array_<T> object
  is declared (that is, when an Array_<T> is default-constructed); in
  that case both begin() and end() are null.
- Array_<T> methods are extremely fast in Release builds with zero overhead,
  inline, unchecked methods. The implementations of inline methods are kept
  small to ensure that they are actually inlined in practice; and generated
  assembly code was examined to make sure.
- There are some dangerous extensions provided that permit the expert user
  to construct objects directly into the array without having to copy them,
  a big win for complicated objects and even bigger for those that don't
  have copy constructors!
- There is a constant-time eraseFast() method you can use if you don't mind the
  array being reordered after the erase. This avoids the extremely expensive
  "compress" activity required by the standard erase() method.
- The optional index-type template parameter can be used to reduce the memory
  footprint to as little as 8 bytes on a 32 bit machine (e.g., a 32 bit
  pointer and two shorts).
- The default size_type for an Array_<T> is a 32-bit unsigned integer rather
  than a size_t. On a 64-bit machine that keeps the memory footprint down
  substantially since the structure is then one 64-bit pointer and two 32-bit
  integers, fitting tightly into a cleanly alignable 16 bytes.


@par Functionality:
For the most part Array_<T> is a plug-compatible replacement for std::vector<T>,
and everything that both classes can do is done with an identical API. However,
there are a few additions and subtractions:

- This class always uses the default new/delete allocator; there is no option
  to specify your own as there is in std::vector.
- Instead of an allocator, the second template argument X to Array_<T,X> is an
  optional index type which can be used to provide type-safe indexing (i.e. the
  array can only be indexed by indices of a particular type, like
  MobilizedBodyIndex). This has zero performance cost if the index is an
  integral type or class consisting of only an integral value such as those
  produced by the SimTK_DEFINE_UNIQUE_INDEX_TYPE macro.
- You can create uninitialized slots in the array and construct directly into
  them rather than having to construct a temporary object which must then be
  copied into the array.
- You can create Array_<T> objects that reference existing data, including
  the contents of std::vectors.
- This class implements the std::vector features from the C++11 standard (with
  a few exceptions; see below).

@par Compatibility:
Included here are binary compatibility issues and compatibility with the C++
standard STL objects.

- Most important, it is safe to pass an Array_<T> through an API to a binary
  library without worrying about compiler version or Release/Debug compatibility
  issues. For a given compiler (e.g. gcc or Microsoft cl) and word size (64 bit
  vs. 32 bit), Array_<T> has an extremely stable memory layout that is preserved
  across compiler versions, and between Release and Debug builds. This allows us
  to use Array_<T> in the SimTK API where use of std::vector<T> would be
  desirable but problematic.
- It supports all standard types, methods, iterators, and operators of the
  C++11 standard std::vector, so it works smoothly with all STL containers and
  algorithms. However, it does not provide the same guarantees of behavior
  when exceptions occur. In particular, when resizing Array_ will use move
  construction if available even if the move constructor hasn't been marked
  "nothrow".
- It is convertible to and from std::vector, usually without copying the
  elements. It is easy to provide APIs that accept either Array_<T> or
  std::vector<T>; the std::vector's data is referenced by an Array_ handle
  that is used to convey the data across the API without binary compatibility
  problems.

/** @name           Assignment methods and operators

These methods put new data values in an existing array, but the meaning of
assignment is subtly different for resizeable (owner) arrays and fixed
(non-owner) arrays. The standard std::vector type is always an owner so the
non-owner description here is an extension applying only to Array_.

For the normal case of resizeable arrays, assignment does not have an
elementwise definition because the source will typically have a different
number of elements than the array's current size. So regardless of the actual
numbers, assignment in the resizeable case is defined as it is for std::vector:
first clear the array by erasing (destructing) all the current elements in the
array, then reserve sufficient heap space to hold a copy of the source, then
use appropriate constructors of type T (most commonly T's copy constructor
T(T)) to initialize each element to be a copy of the corresponding source
element. T's assignment operators are never used in this case.

For fixed arrays, the source must have the same number of elements as are
currently in the array and the meaning is conventional elementwise assignment;
that is, an appropriate assignment operator of type T (most commonly T's copy
assignment operator T=T) is used to change the value of each existing element.

So there are different requirements on the value type T for owner and non-owner
assignments to type T2: for owner assignment T must have a constructor T(T2)
available; for non-owner assignment, T must have an assignment operator T=T2
available.

@remarks
- When reallocating the destination array, we may reuse the existing heap
allocation if it is sufficient and not \e too big; otherwise we'll reallocate
before copying.
- The fill() method here has elementwise assignment semantics regardless of
whether the array is an owner or non-owner. **/

For a non-owner array, this is only allowed if n=last1-first equals the

how many elements n=last1-first the source contains in advance, we'll do only
a single allocation here and call one of T's constructors exactly n times after
just size() destructor calls needed to erase the original data. If the
iterators are random access iterators, calculating n is a fast constant-time
operation. For forward or bidirectional iterators, we have to advance through
the iterators once to count the source elements prior to allocating space,
adding an O(n) cost. For input iterators, we can't count them in advance so
we just have to add elements as we find them using push_back() meaning we may
need to reallocate log(n) times, calling the destructor and copy constructor
each time to move the elements around.

  - If you are appending a default-constructed object of type T, consider using

    internally. That avoids a call to the copy constructor which can be

  - If you are constructing the source object with a non-default constructor,

    copy-construct, consider using the non-standard and dangerous method
    raw_push_back() which enables you to construct the new element in place.
