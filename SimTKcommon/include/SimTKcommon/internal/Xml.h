/** This class provides a minimalist capability for reading and writing XML 
documents, as files or strings. This is based with gratitude on the excellent 
open source XML parser TinyXML (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/). Note 
that this is a <em>non-validating</em> parser, meaning it deals only with the 
XML file itself and not with a Document Type Definition (DTD), XML Schema, or 
any other description of the XML file's expected contents. Instead, the 
structure of your code that uses this class encodes the expected structure 
and contents of the XML document.

Our in-memory model of an XML document is simplified even further than 
TinyXML's. There a lot to know about XML; you could start here: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML. However, everything you need to know in
order to read and write XML documents with the SimTK::Xml::Document class is 
described below.

Much of the detailed documentation is in the class Xml::Element; be sure to look
there as well as at this overview.

<h2>Our in-memory model of an XML document</h2>

We consider an XML document to be a tree of "Nodes". There are only four
types of nodes: Comments, Unknowns, %Text, and Elements. Only Elements can 
contain Text and other nodes, including recursively child Element nodes. 
Elements can also have "Attributes" which are name:value pairs (not nodes).

The XML document as a whole is represented by an object of class Xml::Document.
The Xml::Document object directly contains a short list of nodes, consisting 
only of Comments, Unknowns, and a single %Element called the "root element". The
tag word associated with the root element is called the "root tag" and 
conventionally identifies the kind of document this is. For example, XML files
produced by VTK begin with a root tag "<VTKFile>".

We go to some pain to make sure every Xml::Document fits the above model so 
that you don't have to think about anything else. For example, if the file as 
read in has multiple root-level elements, or has document-level text, we will 
enclose all the element and text nodes within document start tag "<_Root>"
and end tag "</_Root>" thus making it fit the description above. We call
this "canonicalizing" the document.

<h3>%Value Elements</h3>

Element nodes can be classified into "value elements" and "compound
elements". A value element is a "leaf" element (no child elements) that 
contains at most one Text node. For example, a document might contain value
elements like these:
@code
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <rating>7.2</rating>
    <winnings currency=euro>3429</winnings>
    <preferences/>
    <vector>1.2 -4 2e-3</vector>
@endcode
All of these have a unique value so it makes sense to talk about "the" value
of these elements (the empty "preferences" element has a null value). These 
are very common in XML documents, and the Xml::Element class makes them very 
easy to work with. For example, if Element elt is the "<vector>" element
from the example, you could retrieve its value as a Vec3 like this:
@code
    Vec3 v = elt.getValueAs<Vec3>(); 
@endcode
This would automatically throw an error if the element wasn't a value element 
or if its value didn't have the right format to convert to a Vec3.

Note that it is okay for a value element to have attributes; those are ignored
in determining the element's value. Any element that is not a value element is 
a "compound element", meaning it has either child elements and/or more than 
one %Text node.

<h2>Reading an XML document</h2>

To read an XML document, you create an Xml::Document object and tell it to 
read in the document from a file or from a string. The document will be parsed
and canonicalized into the in-memory model described above. Then to rummage 
around in the document, you ask the Xml::Document object for its root element,
and check the root tag to see that it is the type of document you are 
expecting. You can check the root element's attributes, and then process its 
contents (child nodes). Iterators are provided for running through all the
attributes, all the child nodes contained in the element, or all the child
nodes of a particular type. For a child node that is an element,
you check the tag and then pass the element to some piece of code that knows
how to deal with that kind of element and its children recursively.

Here is a complete example of reading in an Xml file "example.xml", printing
the root tag and then the types of all the document-level nodes, in STL
iterator style:
@code
    Xml::Document doc("example.xml");
    cout << "Root tag: " << ex.getRootTag() << endl;
    for (Xml::node_iterator p=doc.node_begin(); p != doc.node_end(); ++p)
        cout << "Node type: " << p->getNodeTypeAsString() << endl;
@endcode
Exactly one of the above nodes will have type "ElementNode"; that is the
root element. To print out the types of nodes contained in the root element,
you could write:
@code
    Xml::Element root = ex.getRootElement();
    for (Xml::node_iterator p=root.node_begin(); p != root.node_end(); ++p)
        cout << "Node type: " << p->getNodeTypeAsString() << endl;
@endcode

<h2>Writing an XML document</h2>

You can insert, remove, and modify nodes and attributes in a document, or 
create a document from scratch. Then you can write the results in a 
"pretty-printed" or compact format to a file or a string; for pretty-printing
you can override the default indentation string (four spaces). Whenever we 
write an XML document, we write it in canoncial format, regardless of how it 
looked when we found it.

At the document level, you can only insert Comment and Unknown nodes. Text and
Element nodes can be inserted only at the root element level and below.

<h2>Details about XML</h2>

This section provides detailed information about the syntax of XML files as
we accept and produce them. You won't have to know these details to read and
write XML files using the SimTK::Xml::Document class, but you may find this 
helpful for when you have to look at an XML file in a text editor.

<h3>Lexical elements</h3>

(Ignore the quote characters below; those are present so I can get this text
through Doxygen.)
  - An XML document is a string of Unicode characters; all metadata is case
    sensitive.
  - The file begins with a "declaration" tag beginning with "<?xml" and ending
    with "?>"
  - Comments look like this: "<!--" \e anything "-->"
  - The characters in an XML file represent \e markup and \e content
  - Markup consists of "tags" delimited by "<" and ">", \e attributes denoted
    by \e name="value", and character escapes delimited by "&" and ";".
  - Tags come in three flavors: \e start tags like "<word>", \e end tags like
    "</word>" and <em>empty element</em> tags like "<word/>". Tag words must
    begin with a letter or an underscore and are case sensitive; "xml" is 
    reserved; don't use it.
  - Attributes are recognized only in start tags, empty element tags, and
    declaration tags. In standard XML the value must be quoted with single or 
    double quotes, but we'll supply missing quotes if there are none.
    Attribute names are case sensitive and must be unique within a tag; but if
    we see duplicates we'll just ignore all but the last.
  - There are five pre-defined escapes: "&lt;" and "&gt;" representing "<" 
    and ">", "&amp;" for ampersand, "&apos;" for apostrophe (single quote)
    and "&quot;" for double quote.
  - There are also "numeric character reference" escapes of the form "&#nnnnn;"
    (decimal) or "&#xnnnn;" (hex), with only as many digits as needed.
  - %Text set off by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>" is interpreted as a raw byte stream.
  - Tags that begin "<x" where x is not a letter or underscore and isn't one
    of the above recognized patterns will be passed through uninterpreted.
  - Anything else is Unicode text. 

<h3>File structure</h3>

An XML file contains a single \e document which consists at the top level of 
  - a declaration
  - comments and unknowns
  - a root element
  - more comments and unknowns

Elements can be containers of other nodes and are thus the basis for the tree
structure of XML files. Elements can contain:
  - comments
  - unknowns
  - text
  - child elements, recursively
  - attributes

A declaration (see below) also has attributes, but there are only three: 
version, encoding, and standalone ('yes' or 'no'). Unknowns are constructs 
found in the file that are not recognized; they might be errors but they are 
likely to be more sophisticated uses of XML that our feeble parser doesn't 
understand. Unknowns are tags where the tag word doesn't begin with a letter or
underscore and isn't one of the very few other tags we recognize, like
comments. As an example, a DTD tag like this would come through as an Unknown 
node here:
@code
    <!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "Note.dtd">
@endcode

Here is the top-level structure we expect of a well-formed XML document, and
we will impose this structure on XML documents that don't have it. This allows
us to simplify the in-memory model as discussed above.
@code
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!-- maybe comments and unknowns -->
    <roottag attr=value ... >
        ... contents ...
    </roottag>
    <!-- maybe comments and unknowns -->
@endcode
That is, the first line should be a declaration, most commonly exactly the
characters shown above, without the "standalone" attribute which will 
default to "yes". If we don't see a declaration when reading an XML
document, we'll assume we read the one above. Then the document should contain 
exactly one root element representing the type of document and 
document-level attributes. The tag for the root element is not literally 
"roottag" but some name that makes sense for the given document. Note that the 
root element is an ordinary element so "contents" can contain text and child 
elements (as well as comments and unknowns).

When reading an XML document, if it has exactly one document-level element and 
no document-level text, we'll take the document as-is. If there is 
more than one document-level element, or we find some document-level text, 
we'll assume that the root element is missing and act as though we had seen a 
root element "<_Root>" at the beginning and "</_Root>" at the end so
the root tag will be "_Root". Note that this means that we will
interpret even a plain text file as a well-formed XML document:
@code
    A file consisting            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    of just text         ==>     <_Root>
    like this.                   A file consisting of just text like this.
                                 </_Root>
@endcode
The above XML document has a single document-level element and that element
contains one Text node whose value is the original text.

/** Abstract handle for holding any kind of node in an XML tree. The concrete
node handle types derived from Node are: Comment, Unknown, Text, and Element. 
Only an Element node may contain other nodes. 

A node may be classified by who owns it. There are three possibilities:
  - Top-level node: The node belongs to the top-level Xml document and does
    not have a parent node.
  - Child node: The node belongs to an element, which may be the root element
    or any lower-level element. The element that owns it is its "parent".
  - Orphan node: The node is not yet part of any Xml document and does not
    belong to an element. In that case the Node handle serves as the owner and
    the node does not have a parent node.

A Node handle may also be empty, meaning it refers to no node at all so there
is nothing to own.

Top-level nodes can only be Comment nodes, Unknown nodes, or the lone root
Element node. Child nodes and orphans can be of Element and Text type also.
Normally orphans exist only briefly during the time a new node is constructed
and the time it is adopted by some element (usually in the same constructor)
so you can ignore them for the most part. But if you must keep orphan nodes
around, be aware that they must be referenced by only one handle at a time to 
avoid ownership conflicts. **/

/** This is a helper function for use when implementing fromXmlElement()

This function does the following:

-# ensures the tag name of the Xml::Element is the same as the

-# if the `requiredName` is not empty, ensures the Xml::Element has a "name"
   attribute set to `requiredName`;
-# ensures the Xml::Element has a "version" attribute set to `requiredVersion`;
-# deserializes the provided `fields` by invoking `fromXmlElementHelper()` on
   each of them (note: AbstractValue%s are handled differently).

The fields to deserialize are specified as a variable number of arguments,
each one being of type `std::pair<T*, const char*>`, where `T` is the type of
the field to deserialize. The first item in the pair will hold the deserialized
value, and the second item is the name of Xml element holding that field
(should be the same as in `toXmlElement()` for the same type `T`).

The order of the fields must be the same as that in the Xml::Element.

#### %AbstractValues

This function can handle fields that are AbstractValue%s,
so long as they are held in a smart pointer with a `reset()` method. 
You must use a smart pointer with ownership semantics; otherwise, you
will introduce a memory leak. We have tested std::unique_ptr and
SimTK::ClonePtr. More complicated smart pointers,
such as `SimTK::ResetOnCopy<std::unique_ptr<AbstractValue>>`, do not work; in
this case, create a temporary local `std::unique_ptr<AbstractValue>`.

@code

        fromXmlElementHelperHelper("Foo", 1, e, requiredName,
                std::make_pair(&a, "a"),

                std::make_pair(&c, "c"));
    }
private:
    double a;
    SimTK::Vec3 b;
    // Smart pointers will be reset to deserialized object.
    SimTK::ClonePtr<AbstractValue> c;
};

/** Partial specialization for XML serialization of ArrayViewConst_ objects.
The output is identical for this class, or its derived classes ArrayView_ and
Array_, although there are other signatures for those to ensure this method
gets used. The result is a single element with tag word `<Array>` with a `name`
attribute if a non-empty name is suppliee, an element count attribute 'n' and a
`version` attributes. Then each entry is a subelement, as produced by type T's 
`toXmlElement()` method.

Note that ArrayViewConst_ can't be a target for deserializaton since
it is immutable.
