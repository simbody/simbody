/** <b>(Deprecated)</b> This class represents a "thread local" variable: one
which may have a different value on each thread; use C++11 `thread_local`
instead. This class is no longer necessary since C++11 has `thread_local` as a
built-in keyword -- you should use that instead.

Thread-local storage is useful in many situations when writing multithreaded
code. For example, it can be used as temporary workspace for calculations. If a
single workspace object were created, all access to it would need to be
synchronized to prevent threads from overwriting each other's values. Using a
`ThreadLocal<T>` instead means that a separate workspace object of type
`T` will automatically be created for each thread. That object will have
"thread scope" meaning it will be destructed only on thread termination. Note
that that means it can outlive destruction of the `ThreadLocal<T>` object.

To use it, simply create a `ThreadLocal<T>`, then call get() or upd() to get a
readable or writable reference to the value of type `T` that is available for
the exclusive use of the current thread:
@code
    ThreadLocal<int> x;
    ...
    x.upd() = 5;
    assert(x.get() == 5);
@endcode

@warning You should avoid allocating `ThreadLocal` objects in single-threaded
code because the objects of type `T` have "thread scope"; they do not get
destructed when the `ThreadLocal` object does. So in the single-threaded case
they will persist until program termination, creating a potential for leaks.
