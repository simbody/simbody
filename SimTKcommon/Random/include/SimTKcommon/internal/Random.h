namespace SimTK {

/**
 * This class defines the interface for pseudo-random number generators.  Subclasses generate numbers according to specific
 * distributions.  Currently, there are two such subclasses: Random::Uniform and Random::Gaussian.  For example, to generate
 * a series of pseudo-random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100, you would call:
 * <pre>
 *   Random::Uniform random(0.0, 100.0);
 *   Real nextValue = random.getValue(); // Each time you call this, it will return a different value.
 * </pre>
 * Although the numbers are distributed in a seemingly random way, they are nonetheless deterministic, so you can create
 * several random number generators that each returns exactly the same sequence of numbers.  The sequence is determined
 * by the seed value with which the Random object is initialized.  By default, a different seed is used for every object.
 * You can invoke setSeed(int seed) on a Random object to explicitly specify the seed to use.  Each seed
 * value corresponds to a different sequence of numbers that is uncorrelated with all others.
 *
 * This class is implemented using the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT) library.  It provides
 * good performance, excellent statistical properties, and a very long period.
 *
 * The methods of this class do not provide any synchronization or other mechanism to ensure thread safety.
 * It is therefore important that a single Random object not be accessed from multiple threads. One minor
 * concession to threads: even if you don't set the seed explicitly, each thread's Random object will
 * use a different seed so you'll get a unique series of numbers in each thread.
