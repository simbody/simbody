/** This object is intended to contain all state information for a 
SimTK::System, except topological information which is stored in the %System 
itself. 

A SimTK::System is "const" after its topology has been constructed and realized.
Anything changeable is instead stored in a %State. Systems contain a set of 
Subsystem objects, and %State supports that concept by allowing per-subsystem 
partitioning of the total system state. This allows subsystems to have their own
private state variables, while permitting the system to allow shared access to 
state among the subsystems when necessary.

The %State provides services reflecting the structure of the equations it 
expects to find in the System. Three different views of the same state 
information are supported to accommodate three different users:
   - the system as a whole
   - Subsystems contained in the system
   - numerical methods operating on the state

Typically numerical methods have a much less nuanced view of the state
than do the system or subsystems.

The system is expected to be a "hybrid DAE", that is, a mixture of continuous 
and discrete dynamic equations, and algebraic constraints. There is an 
independent variable t, continuous state variables y, and discrete state 
variables d.

The continuous part is an ODE-on-a-manifold system suitable for solution via 
coordinate projection, structured like this for the view taken by numerical 
methods:
<pre>
     (1)  y' = f(d;t,y)         differential equations
     (2)  c  = c(d;t,y)         algebraic equations (manifold is c=0)
     (3)  e  = e(d;t,y)         event triggers (watch for zero crossings)
</pre>
with initial conditions t0,y0,d0 such that c=0. The discrete variables d are 
updated upon occurrence of specific events. When those events are functions of 
time or state, they are detected using the set of scalar-valued event trigger 
functions e (3).

In the more detailed view as seen from the System, we consider y={q,u,z} to 
be partitioned into position variables q, velocity variables u, and auxiliary 
variables z. There will be algebraic constraints involving q, u, and u's time 
derivatives udot. The system is now assumed to look like this:
<pre>
     (4) qdot    = N(q) u
     (5) zdot    = zdot(d;t,q,u,z)

     (6) M(q) udot + ~G(q) mult = f(d;t,q,u,z)
         G(q) udot              = b(d;t,q,u)

                   [ pdotdot(d;t,q,u,udot) ]
     (7) udotErr = [ vdot(d;t,q,u,udot)    ] = 0
                   [ a(d;t,q,u,udot)       ] 

     (8) uErr    = [ pdot(d;t,q,u) ]         = 0
                   [ v(d;t,q,u)    ]

     (9) qErr    = [ p(d;t,q) ]              = 0
                   [ n(q)     ]
</pre>
The q's can also be dealt with directly as second order variables via
<pre>
    (10) qdotdot = Ndot(q,qdot) u + N(q) udot
</pre>

Here G = [P;V;A] with A(q) being the coefficient matrix for constraints
appearing only at the acceleration level, and V(q)=partial(v)/partial(u)
the coefficient matrix for the velocity (nonholonomic) constraints, and
P(q)=partial(pdot)/partial(u) is the coefficient matrix of the first
time derivatives of the position (holonomic) constraints.
Note that uErr in Eq 8 is assumed to include equations resulting from
differentiation of p() in Eq 9, as well as ones first introduced at the
velocity level (nonholonomic constraints), and udotErr is similarly 
built from acceleration-only constraints a() and derivatives of higher-level
constraints.

If a system allocates nq q's, nu u's, and nz z's the State will also allocate 
matching cache variables qdot, qdotdot, udot, and zdot. If mp position 
(holonomic) constraints (9), mpv velocity constraints (8) and mpva acceleration
constraints (7) are allocated, the state creates cache entries of like sizes 
qErr, uErr, udotErr. In addition room for the mpva Lagrange multipliers 'mult' 
is allocated in the cache.

In the final view, the Subsystem view, the same variables and cache entries 
exist, but only the ones allocated by that Subsystem are visible. All of a 
Subsystem's q's are consecutive in memory, as are its u's, uErr's, etc., but 
the q's are not adjacent to the u's as they are for the System's view.

The default constructor creates a %State containing no state variables and with 
its realization cache stage set to Stage::Empty. During subsystem construction,
variables and cache entries for any stage can be allocated, however \e all 
Model stage variables must be allocated during this time. At the end of 
construction, call advanceSubsystemToStage(Topology) which will put the 
subsystem at Stage::Topology. Then the subsystems realize their Model stages, 
during which variables at any stage > Model, and cache entries at any stage
>= Model can be allocated. After that call advanceSubsystemToStage(Model)
which sets the stage to Stage::Model and disallows further state allocation.

Note that there is a global Stage for the state as a whole, and individual
Stages for each subsystem. The global stage can never be higher than
the lowest subsystem stage. Global state resources are allocated when the
global Stage advances to "Model" and tossed out if that stage is
invalidated. Similarly, cache resources are allocated at stage Instance
and forgotten when Instance is invalidated. Note that subsystems will
"register" their use of the global variable pools during their own modeling
stages, but that the actual global resources won't exist until the \e system 
has been advanced to Model or Instance stage.

hidden implementation class, StateImpl. Most of the methods here are inline

/** This method allocates a DiscreteVariable whose value should be updated
automatically after each time step. A CacheEntry of the same value type as
the variable is allocated to hold the update value. The discrete variable is 
allocated as described for allocateDiscreteVariable(), except that the 
\a invalidates stage must be higher than Stage::Time. The cache entry is 
allocated as described for allocateCacheEntry() without an automatic calculation
(\a latest) stage. The cache entry is then considered to be the "update" value
for the discrete variable. Update values play a similar role for
discrete variables as derivatives play for continuous variables. That is, they
define how the variable is to be updated when a TimeStepper accepts a step.

Update occurs as follows: at the start of every continuous interval, after all
other pending events have been handled, a time stepper should call the State
method autoUpdateDiscreteVariables(). That method looks at all the
auto-update discrete variables to see which ones have valid update values. For
each valid value, the discrete variable and its update value are swapped, and
the new cache value is marked invalid. 

@note No stage is invalidated by the swap even though this is clearly modifying
the state variable. It is up to the user of this variable to make sure that is
reasonable, by using the <em>update value</em>, not the <em>variable value</em>
for computations during realize(). In that way the results are always calculated 
using the value as it will be \e after an update. That means that no results 
will change when the swap occurs, so no stage needs to be invalidated upon 
updating. If you do use both values, make sure that all computed results remain
unchanged from the end of one step to the beginning of the next. 

The above behavior is entirely analogous to the treatment of continuous
variables like q: the integrator ensures that only updated values of q are
seen when evaluations are made at intermediate or trial steps; you should
do the same. In contrast to this auto-update behavior, any \e explicit change 
to the discrete variable will invalidate the variable's \a invalidates stage 
just as for a non-auto-updating discrete variable. The auto-update cache entry
is always invalidated by an explicit change to the variable, as well as by
the \a updateDependsOn stage being invalidated.

Ownership of the AbstractValue object supplied here is taken over by the 
State -- don't delete the object after this call! A clone() of this value will 
be used in the auto-update cache entry so there will be two objects of this type
around at run time that get swapped back and forth between the state variable 
and the cache entry.

You can allocate discrete variables in a State at Topology stage or Model
stage but not later. That is, you allocate the variable while the State
is in Stage::Empty, and then it appears when you do realizeTopology(); or,
you allocate the variable when the State is in Stage::Topology and it
appears when you do realizeModel().

/** @name                      Cache Entries

You can allocate a new CacheEntry in any State whose stage has not yet been
advanced to Instance stage. The stage at allocation (Empty, Topology, or 
Model) is remembered so that the appropriate cache entries can be forgotten
if the State's stage is reduced back to that stage later after advancing 
past it. CacheEntries are private to each Subsystem and allocated 
immediately. The returned index is unique within the Subsystem and there 
is no corresponding global index. **/
/**@{**/

/** There are two Stages supplied explicitly as arguments to this method: 
\a earliest and \a latest. The \a earliest Stage is the stage at which the 
cache entry \e could be calculated. Hence if the Subsystem stage is reduced
below \a earliest the cache entry is known to be invalid. The \a latest 
Stage, if any, is the stage at which the cache entry is \e guaranteed to 
have been calculated (typically as the result of a System-wide realize()
call to that stage). For stages \a earliest through \a latest-1, the 
cache entry \e may be valid, if it has already been calculated. In that 
case an explicit validity indicator will have been set at the time it was 
computed, via markCacheValueRealized(). That indicator is cleared 
automatically whenever the Subsystem stage is reduced below \a earliest. 
The validity indicator need not have been set in order for the cache entry 
to be deemed valid at \a latest stage.

If \a latest is given as Stage::Infinity then there is no guarantee that 
this Subsystem will automatically calculate a value for this cache entry,
which makes it a "lazy" evaluation that is done only if requested. In that 
case the only way the cache entry can become valid is if the calculation 
is performed and the validity indicator is set explicitly with
markCacheValueRealized(). Here is how we suggest you structure lazy
evaluation of a cache entry CE of type CEType and CacheEntryIndex CEIndex
(this is pseudocode):

(1) Allocate your lazy cache entry something like this:
\code
    CEIndex = s.allocateLazyCacheEntry(subsys,stage,new Value<CEType>());
\endcode
(2) Write a realizeCE() method structured like this:
\code
    void realizeCE(const State& s) const {
        if (s.isCacheValueRealized(subsys,CEIndex)) 
            return;
        // calculate the cache entry, update with updCacheEntry()
        s.markCacheValueRealized(subsys,CEIndex);
    }
\endcode
(3) Write a getCE() method structured like this:
\code
    const CEType& getCE(const State& s) const {
        realizeCE(s); // make sure CE has been calculated
        return Value<CEType>::downcast(s.getCacheEntry(subsys,CEIndex));
    }
\endcode
(4) Write an updCE() method like this:
\code
    CEType& updCE(const State& s) const {
        return Value<CEType>::updDowncast(s.updCacheEntry(subsys,CEIndex));
    }
\endcode

Then access CE \e only through your getCE() method. There
should be only one place in your code where isCacheValueRealized() and
markCacheValueRealized() are called for a particular cache entry. If
you do this from multiple locations there is a high probability of a bug
being introduced, especially due to later modification of the code.

Prior to the Subsystem advancing to \a earliest stage, and prior to \a latest 
stage unless the validity indicator is set, attempts to look at the value via
getCacheEntry() will throw an exception. However, you may access the cache entry
for writing via updCacheEntry() any time after stage \a earliest-1. If you 
evaluate it prior to \a latest, be sure to explicitly mark it valid.
Note that cache entries are mutable so you do not need write
access to the State in order to access a cache entry for writing.

/** Get a unit weighting (1/unit change) for each u that can be used to 
weight a vector du so that the disparate elements are comparable in physical
effect. This permits mixing of generalized speeds
that have different units, and scaling of generalized speeds that have
differing amounts of leverage due to their positions in the multibody tree.
This can be used to create a scaled norm that represents the overall
significance of a change du to u.

Define a unit change di for each ui such that a change
ui+eps*di to each generalized speed in turn produces a physical velocity change
of roughly equal significance. Then a diagonal matrix Wu=diag(1/di) is 
a weighting matrix such that wdu=Wu*du is a vector in which each element wdu_i
has units of "unit change" for its corresponding ui. This method returns a
vector which is the diagonal of Wu.

These same weights on u also determine the scaling of the generalized
coordinates q, because q and u are related via qdot=N*u. For cases where
qdot_i=u_i, the numerical value of the unit change to q_i is just di because 
dP/dq_i == dV/du_i. Otherwise, they are related by Wq = N*Wu*pinv(N) where 
Wq is the weighting matrix for dq (block diagonal), and pinv() is the
pseudoinverse.

For example, say you define unit scaling for an angle coordinate to be 1 radian
(about 57 degrees), meaning that a 1 radian change of coordinate produces
(roughly) one length unit of meaningful position change. Then if a generalized
coordinate is measured in radians, its unit scale would be 1. If instead you 
created a generalized coordinate with units of degrees, its unit scale would 
be 57 degrees. That would allow mixing of such coordinates in the same system 
by bringing the coordinates into a physically-meaningful basis.
Scaling is defined in the u basis where each variable is independent;
the N matrix couples variables in the q basis. So here the units would actually
be 1 radian/time unit and 57 degrees/time unit (numerically identical).
