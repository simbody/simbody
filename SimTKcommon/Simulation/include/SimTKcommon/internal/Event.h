/** An Event is "something that happens" during a Study that is advancing
through time. Its occurence interrupts the normal flow of computation, allowing
an event Handler to adjust the State prior to resuming the Study.

Events are allocated by Subsystems, but require some System global resources.
All Events are given a unique EventId. Some Events require other State
resources, such as slots for the values of trigger functions in the case of
Triggered events.

Events can be allocated at Topology, Model, and Instance Stages. All Event
resources are assigned when the Instance stage is realized. However, if an
Event requires state variables, then it must be allocated by Model stage. **/
class Event {
public:

    /** These are all the possible causes for events.

    @par Initialization
    A Study has performed its own initialization and is about to start.

    @par Triggered
    An event trigger function underwent a monitored sign transition.

    @par Scheduled
    An integrator reached a previously-scheduled time for the Event to occur.

    @par TimeAdvanced
    An integrator completed an internal step, meaning that it has reached
    a point where time has advanced irreversibly.

    @par Signaled
    A flag in the State has been explicitly set, meaning that a particular
    Event has occurred. Anyone with write access to a State can set these,
    but typically they are set in event handlers associated with one of
    the other kinds of events.

    @par Termination
    The Study has finished. If a Termination event handler signals more
    Events, those signaled events are not processed by the Study; that is,
    the signals remain set in the final State.

    In case several of these causes are detected in a single step, they are
    sequentialized in the order shown, like this:

    1. The occurrence of triggered events is reported and the triggering state
       and a list of triggered events are passed to the event handler for
       processing (meaning the state, but not the time, is modified). Note
       that simultaneity *within* the set of triggered events may also require
       special handling; we're not talking about that here, just simultaneity
       of *causes*.
    2. Next, using the state resulting from step 1, the time is checked to see
       if scheduled events have occurred. If so, a list of those events is
       passed to the event handler for processing.
    3. Next, if this system has requested time-advanced events, the event
       handler is called with the state that resulted from step 2 and the "time
       advanced" cause noted. No event list is passed in that case. The state
       may be modified.
    4. Last, if the final time has been reached or if any of the event handlers
       asked for termination, we pass the state to the event handler again
       noting that we have reached termination. The state may be modified and
       the result will be the final state of the simulation.
