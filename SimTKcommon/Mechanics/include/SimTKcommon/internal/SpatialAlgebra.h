/**@defgroup SpatialAlgebraUtilities    Spatial Algebra Utilities
   @ingroup GlobalFunctions

These utility functions are used for manipulation of spatial quantities that
are contained in SpatialVec or SpatialMat objects. These are intended for
expert use and are mostly used in the implemention of friendlier methods such
as those in MobilizedBody that are used to obtain various spatial quantities.

@note Although we use SpatialVec for both, there are two different spatial
vector bases: one for motion quantities like velocities, accelerations, and
momentum and another for forces and impulses; be sure to use the appropriate
functions. Also, we use a pair of ordinary vectors, following Abhi Jain,
rather than the similar but subtly different Plucker basis vectors used by
Roy Featherstone.

Spatial vectors are used for combined (rotational,translational) quantities.
These include
@verbatim
     spatial velocity     = (angularVelocity,linearVelocity)
     spatial acceleration = (angularAcceleration,linearAcceleration)
     spatial force        = (moment,force)
@endverbatim

Spatial configuration (pose) has to be handled differently though since
orientation is not a vector quantity. We use the Transform class for this
concept, which includes an orientation matrix and a translation vector.

would just be the negative of the supplied velocity. However, since the linear
component of spatial velocity has to be measured at a point, and we're
switching from measuring at a point coincident with B's origin OB to one
