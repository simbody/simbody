/**
 * This class provides static methods for finding the roots of polynomials.  There are
 * specialized methods for quadratic and cubic polynomials, as well as general methods
 * for polynomials of arbitrary degree.  In each case, there are methods for polynomials
 * with both real and complex coefficients.
 *
 * There are two different algorithms used by this class.  The specialized methods for
 * quadratic polynomials calculate the roots by explicit evaluation of the quadratic
 * formula.  They use the evaluation method described in section 5.6 of "Numerical
 * Recipes in C++, Second Edition", by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery.
 * In addition, the method for quadratic polynomials with real coefficients performs
 * an extra check to detect when the discriminant is zero to within machine precision.
 * This helps to prevent round-off error from producing a tiny imaginary part in a
 * multiple root.
 *
 * The methods for cubic and arbitrary degree polynomials use the Jenkins-Traub method,
 * as implemented in the classic RPOLY and CPOLY functions:
 *
 * Jenkins, M. A. and Traub, J. F. (1972), Algorithm 419: Zeros of a Complex Polynomial, Comm. ACM, 15, 97-99.
 *
 * Jenkins, M. A. (1975), Algorithm 493: Zeros of a Real Polynomial, ACM TOMS, 1, 178-189.
 *
 * This is an iterative method that provides rapid convergence and high accuracy in most cases.
