1. about
--------

PNG is a file format to store raster images losslessly with good compression,
supporting different color types. It can be implemented in a patent-free way.

LodePNG is a PNG codec according to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
Specification (Second Edition) - W3C Recommendation 10 November 2003.

The specifications used are:

*) Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition):
     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110
*) RFC 1950 ZLIB Compressed Data Format version 3.3:
     http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-zlib.html
*) RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification ver 1.3:
     http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-deflate.html

The most recent version of LodePNG can currently be found at
http://members.gamedev.net/lode/projects/LodePNG/

LodePNG works both in C (ISO C90) and C++, with a C++ wrapper that adds
extra functionality.

LodePNG exists out of two files:
-lodepng.h: the header file for both C and C++
-lodepng.c(pp): give it the name lodepng.c or lodepng.cpp depending on your usage

If you want to start using LodePNG right away without reading this doc, get the
files lodepng_examples.c or lodepng_examples.cpp to see how to use it in code,
or check the (smaller) examples in chapter 13 here.

LodePNG is simple but only supports the basic requirements. To achieve
simplicity, the following design choices were made: There are no dependencies
on any external library. To decode PNGs, there's a Decoder struct or class that
can convert any PNG file data into an RGBA image buffer with a single function
call. To encode PNGs, there's an Encoder struct or class that can convert image
data into PNG file data with a single function call. To read and write files,
there are simple functions to convert the files to/from buffers in memory.

This all makes LodePNG suitable for loading textures in games, demoscene
productions, saving a screenshot, images in programs that require them for simple
usage, ... It's less suitable for full fledged image editors, loading PNGs
over network (it requires all the image data to be available before decoding can
begin), life-critical systems, ...
LodePNG has a standards conformant decoder and encoder, and supports the ability
to make a somewhat conformant editor.

1.1. supported features
-----------------------

The following features are supported by the decoder:

*) decoding of PNGs with any color type, bit depth and interlace mode, to a 24- or 32-bit color raw image, or the same color type as the PNG
*) encoding of PNGs, from any raw image to 24- or 32-bit color, or the same color type as the raw image
*) Adam7 interlace and deinterlace for any color type
*) loading the image from harddisk or decoding it from a buffer from other sources than harddisk
*) support for alpha channels, including RGBA color model, translucent palettes and color keying
*) zlib decompression (inflate)
*) zlib compression (deflate)
*) CRC32 and ADLER32 checksums
*) handling of unknown chunks, allowing making a PNG editor that stores custom and unknown chunks.
*) the following chunks are supported (generated/interpreted) by both encoder and decoder:
    IHDR: header information
    PLTE: color palette
    IDAT: pixel data
    IEND: the final chunk
    tRNS: transparency for palettized images
    tEXt: textual information
    zTXt: compressed textual information
    iTXt: international textual information
    bKGD: suggested background color
    pHYs: physical dimensions
    tIME: modification time

1.2. features not supported
---------------------------

The following features are _not_ supported:

*) some features needed to make a conformant PNG-Editor might be still missing.
*) partial loading/stream processing. All data must be available and is processed in one call.
*) The following public chunks are not supported but treated as unknown chunks by LodePNG
    cHRM, gAMA, iCCP, sRGB, sBIT, hIST, sPLT


2. C and C++ version
--------------------

The C version uses buffers allocated with alloc that you need to free()
yourself. On top of that, you need to use init and cleanup functions for each
struct whenever using a struct from the C version to avoid exploits and memory leaks.

The C++ version has constructors and destructors that take care of these things,
and uses std::vectors in the interface for storing data.

Both the C and the C++ version are contained in this file! The C++ code depends on
the C code, the C code works on its own.

These files work without modification for both C and C++ compilers because all the
additional C++ code is in "#ifdef __cplusplus" blocks that make C-compilers ignore
it, and the C code is made to compile both with strict ISO C90 and C++.

To use the C++ version, you need to rename the source file to lodepng.cpp (instead
of lodepng.c), and compile it with a C++ compiler.

To use the C version, you need to rename the source file to lodepng.c (instead
of lodepng.cpp), and compile it with a C compiler.


3. Security
-----------

As with most software, even if carefully designed, it's always possible that
LodePNG may contain possible exploits.

If you discover a possible exploit, please let me know, and it will be fixed.

When using LodePNG, care has to be taken with the C version of LodePNG, as well as the C-style
structs when working with C++. The following conventions are used for all C-style structs:

-if a struct has a corresponding init function, always call the init function when making a new one, to avoid exploits
-if a struct has a corresponding cleanup function, call it before the struct disappears to avoid memory leaks
-if a struct has a corresponding copy function, use the copy function instead of "=". The destination must also be inited already!

4. Decoding
-----------

Decoding converts a PNG compressed image to a raw pixel buffer.

Most documentation on using the decoder is at its declarations in the header
above. For C, simple decoding can be done with functions such as LodePNG_decode32,
and more advanced decoding can be done with the struct LodePNG_Decoder and its
functions. For C++, simple decoding can be done with the LodePNG::decode functions
and advanced decoding with the LodePNG::Decoder class.

The Decoder contains 3 components:
*) LodePNG_InfoPng: it stores information about the PNG (the input) in an LodePNG_InfoPng struct, don't modify this one yourself
*) Settings: you can specify a few other settings for the decoder to use
*) LodePNG_InfoRaw: here you can say what type of raw image (the output) you want to get

Some of the parameters described below may be inside the sub-struct "LodePNG_InfoColor color".
In the C and C++ version, when using Info structs outside of the decoder or encoder, you need to use their
init and cleanup functions, but normally you use the ones in the decoder that are already handled
in the init and cleanup functions of the decoder itself.

=LodePNG_InfoPng=

This contains information such as the original color type of the PNG image, text
comments, suggested background color, etc... More details about the LodePNG_InfoPng struct
are at its declaration documentation.

Because the dimensions of the image are important, there are shortcuts to get them in the
C++ version: use decoder.getWidth() and decoder.getHeight().
In the C version, use decoder.infoPng.width and decoder.infoPng.height.

=LodePNG_InfoRaw=

In the LodePNG_InfoRaw struct of the Decoder, you can specify which color type you want
the resulting raw image to be. If this is different from the colorType of the
PNG, then the decoder will automatically convert the result to your LodePNG_InfoRaw
settings. Not all combinations of color conversions are supported though, see
a different section for information about the color modes and supported conversions.

Palette of LodePNG_InfoRaw isn't used by the Decoder, when converting from palette color
to palette color, the values of the pixels are left untouched so that the colors
will change if the palette is different. Color key of LodePNG_InfoRaw is not used by the
Decoder. If setting color_convert is false then LodePNG_InfoRaw is completely ignored,
but it will be modified to match the color type of the PNG so will be overwritten.

By default, 32-bit color is used for the result.

=Settings=

The Settings can be used to ignore the errors created by invalid CRC and Adler32
chunks, and to disable the decoding of tEXt chunks.

There's also a setting color_convert, true by default. If false, no conversion
is done, the resulting data will be as it was in the PNG (after decompression)
and you'll have to puzzle the colors of the pixels together yourself using the
color type information in the LodePNG_InfoPng.


5. Encoding
-----------

Encoding converts a raw pixel buffer to a PNG compressed image.

Most documentation on using the encoder is at its declarations in the header
above. For C, simple encoding can be done with functions such as LodePNG_encode32,
and more advanced decoding can be done with the struct LodePNG_Encoder and its
functions. For C++, simple encoding can be done with the LodePNG::encode functions
and advanced decoding with the LodePNG::Encoder class.

Like the decoder, the encoder can also give errors. However it gives less errors
since the encoder input is trusted, the decoder input (a PNG image that could
be forged by anyone) is not trusted.

Like the Decoder, the Encoder has 3 components:
*) LodePNG_InfoRaw: here you say what color type of the raw image (the input) has
*) Settings: you can specify a few settings for the encoder to use
*) LodePNG_InfoPng: the same LodePNG_InfoPng struct as created by the Decoder. For the encoder,
with this you specify how you want the PNG (the output) to be.

Some of the parameters described below may be inside the sub-struct "LodePNG_InfoColor color".
In the C and C++ version, when using Info structs outside of the decoder or encoder, you need to use their
init and cleanup functions, but normally you use the ones in the encoder that are already handled
in the init and cleanup functions of the decoder itself.

=LodePNG_InfoPng=

The Decoder class stores information about the PNG image in an LodePNG_InfoPng object. With
the Encoder you can do the opposite: you give it an LodePNG_InfoPng object, and it'll try
to match the LodePNG_InfoPng you give as close as possible in the PNG it encodes. For
example in the LodePNG_InfoPng you can specify the color type you want to use, possible
tEXt chunks you want the PNG to contain, etc... For an explanation of all the
values in LodePNG_InfoPng see a further section. Not all PNG color types are supported
by the Encoder.

The encoder will not always exactly match the LodePNG_InfoPng struct you give,
it tries as close as possible. Some things are ignored by the encoder. The width
and height of LodePNG_InfoPng are ignored as well, because instead the width and
height of the raw image you give in the input are used. In fact the encoder
currently uses only the following settings from it:
-colorType and bitDepth: the ones it supports
-text chunks, that you can add to the LodePNG_InfoPng with "addText"
-the color key, if applicable for the given color type
-the palette, if you encode to a PNG with colorType 3
-the background color: it'll add a bKGD chunk to the PNG if one is given
-the interlaceMethod: None (0) or Adam7 (1)

When encoding to a PNG with colorType 3, the encoder will generate a PLTE chunk.
If the palette contains any colors for which the alpha channel is not 255 (so
there are translucent colors in the palette), it'll add a tRNS chunk.

=LodePNG_InfoRaw=

You specify the color type of the raw image that you give to the input here,
including a possible transparent color key and palette you happen to be using in
your raw image data.

By default, 32-bit color is assumed, meaning your input has to be in RGBA
format with 4 bytes (unsigned chars) per pixel.

=Settings=

The following settings are supported (some are in sub-structs):
*) autoLeaveOutAlphaChannel: when this option is enabled, when you specify a PNG
color type with alpha channel (not to be confused with the color type of the raw
image you specify!!), but the encoder detects that all pixels of the given image
are opaque, then it'll automatically use the corresponding type without alpha
channel, resulting in a smaller PNG image.
*) btype: the block type for LZ77. 0 = uncompressed, 1 = fixed huffman tree, 2 = dynamic huffman tree (best compression)
*) useLZ77: whether or not to use LZ77 for compressed block types
*) windowSize: the window size used by the LZ77 encoder (1 - 32768)
*) force_palette: if colorType is 2 or 6, you can make the encoder write a PLTE
   chunk if force_palette is true. This can used as suggested palette to convert
   to by viewers that don't support more than 256 colors (if those still exist)
*) add_id: add text chunk "Encoder: LodePNG <version>" to the image.
*) text_compression: default 0. If 1, it'll store texts as zTXt instead of tEXt chunks.
  zTXt chunks use zlib compression on the text. This gives a smaller result on
  large texts but a larger result on small texts (such as a single program name).
  It's all tEXt or all zTXt though, there's no separate setting per text yet.


6. color conversions
--------------------

In LodePNG, the color mode (bits, channels and palette) used in the PNG image,
and the color mode used in the raw data, are separate and independently
configurable. Therefore, LodePNG needs to do conversions from one color mode to
another. Not all possible conversions are supported (e.g. converting to a color
model with palette isn't supported). This section will explain which conversions
are supported and how to configure this. This explains for example when LodePNG
uses the settings in LodePNG_InfoPng, LodePNG_InfoRaw and Settings.

6.1. PNG color types
--------------------

A PNG image can have many color types, ranging from 1-bit color to 64-bit color,
as well as palettized color modes. After the zlib decompression and unfiltering
in the PNG image is done, the raw pixel data will have that color type and thus
a certain amount of bits per pixel. If you want the output raw image after
decoding to have another color type, a conversion is done by LodePNG.

The PNG specification mentions the following color types:

0: greyscale, bit depths 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
2: RGB, bit depths 8 and 16
3: palette, bit depths 1, 2, 4 and 8
4: greyscale with alpha, bit depths 8 and 16
6: RGBA, bit depths 8 and 16

Bit depth is the amount of bits per color channel.

6.2. Default Behaviour of LodePNG
---------------------------------

By default, the Decoder will convert the data from the PNG to 32-bit RGBA color,
no matter what color type the PNG has, so that the result can be used directly
as a texture in OpenGL etc... without worries about what color type the original
image has.

The Encoder assumes by default that the raw input you give it is a 32-bit RGBA
buffer and will store the PNG as either 32 bit or 24 bit depending on whether
or not any translucent pixels were detected in it.

To get the default behaviour, don't change the values of LodePNG_InfoRaw and LodePNG_InfoPng of
the encoder, and don't change the values of LodePNG_InfoRaw of the decoder.

6.3. Color Conversions
----------------------

As explained in the sections about the Encoder and Decoder, you can specify
color types and bit depths in LodePNG_InfoPng and LodePNG_InfoRaw, to change the default behaviour
explained above. (for the Decoder you can only specify the LodePNG_InfoRaw, because the
LodePNG_InfoPng contains what the PNG file has).

To avoid some confusion:
-the Decoder converts from PNG to raw image
-the Encoder converts from raw image to PNG
-the color type and bit depth in LodePNG_InfoRaw, are those of the raw image
-the color type and bit depth in LodePNG_InfoPng, are those of the PNG
-if the color type of the LodePNG_InfoRaw and PNG image aren't the same, a conversion
between the color types is done if the color types are supported. If it is not
supported, an error is returned.

Supported color conversions:
-It's possible to load PNGs from any colortype and to save PNGs of any colorType.
-Both encoder and decoder use the same converter. So both encoder and decoder
suport the same color types at the input and the output. So the decoder supports
any type of PNG image and can convert it to certain types of raw image, while the
encoder supports any type of raw data but only certain color types for the output PNG.
-The converter can convert from _any_ input color type, to 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA
-The converter can convert from greyscale input color type, to 8-bit greyscale or greyscale with alpha
-If both color types are the same, conversion from anything to anything is possible
-Color types that are invalid according to the PNG specification are not allowed
-When converting from a type with alpha channel to one without, the alpha channel information is discarded
-When converting from a type without alpha channel to one with, the result will be opaque except pixels that have the same color as the color key of the input if one was given
-When converting from 16-bit bitDepth to 8-bit bitDepth, the 16-bit precision information is lost, only the most significant byte is kept
-Converting from color to greyscale or to palette is not supported on purpose: there are multiple possible algorithms to do this color reduction, LodePNG does not want to pick one and leaves this choice to the user instead, because it's beyond the scope of PNG encoding.
-Converting from/to a palette type, only keeps the indices, it ignores the colors defined in the palette

No conversion needed...:
-If the color type of the PNG image and raw image are the same, then no
conversion is done, and all color types are supported.
-In the encoder, you can make it save a PNG with any color by giving the
LodePNG_InfoRaw and LodePNG_InfoPng the same color type.
-In the decoder, you can make it store the pixel data in the same color type
as the PNG has, by setting the color_convert setting to false. Settings in
infoRaw are then ignored.

The function LodePNG_convert does this, which is available in the interface but
normally isn't needed since the encoder and decoder already call it.

6.4. More Notes
---------------

In the PNG file format, if a less than 8-bit per pixel color type is used and the scanlines
have a bit amount that isn't a multiple of 8, then padding bits are used so that each
scanline starts at a fresh byte.
However: The raw input image you give to the encoder, and the raw output image you get from the decoder
will NOT have these padding bits in that case, e.g. in the case of a 1-bit image with a width
of 7 pixels, the first pixel of the second scanline will the the 8th bit of the first byte,
not the first bit of a new byte.

7. error values
---------------

All functions in LodePNG that return an error code, return 0 if everything went 
OK, or one of the codes described below if there was an error.

This are meanings of the LodePNG error values:

*) 0: no error, everything went ok
*) 1: the Encoder/Decoder has done nothing yet, so error checking makes no sense yet
*) 10: while huffman decoding: end of input memory reached without endcode
*) 11: while huffman decoding: error in code tree made it jump outside of tree
*) 13: problem while processing dynamic deflate block
*) 14: problem while processing dynamic deflate block
*) 15: problem while processing dynamic deflate block
*) 16: unexisting code while processing dynamic deflate block
*) 17: while inflating: end of out buffer memory reached
*) 18: while inflating: invalid distance code
*) 19: while inflating: end of out buffer memory reached
*) 20: invalid deflate block BTYPE encountered while decoding
*) 21: NLEN is not ones complement of LEN in a deflate block
*) 22: while inflating: end of out buffer memory reached.
   This can happen if the inflated deflate data is longer than the amount of bytes required to fill up
   all the pixels of the image, given the color depth and image dimensions. Something that doesn't
   happen in a normal, well encoded, PNG image.
*) 23: while inflating: end of in buffer memory reached
*) 24: invalid FCHECK in zlib header
*) 25: invalid compression method in zlib header
*) 26: FDICT encountered in zlib header while it's not used for PNG
*) 27: PNG file is smaller than a PNG header
*) 28: incorrect PNG signature (the first 8 bytes of the PNG file)
   Maybe it's not a PNG, or a PNG file that got corrupted so that the header indicates the corruption.
*) 29: first chunk is not the header chunk
*) 30: chunk length too large, chunk broken off at end of file
*) 31: illegal PNG color type or bpp
*) 32: illegal PNG compression method
*) 33: illegal PNG filter method
*) 34: illegal PNG interlace method
*) 35: chunk length of a chunk is too large or the chunk too small
*) 36: illegal PNG filter type encountered
*) 37: illegal bit depth for this color type given
*) 38: the palette is too big (more than 256 colors)
*) 39: more palette alpha values given in tRNS, than there are colors in the palette
*) 40: tRNS chunk has wrong size for greyscale image
*) 41: tRNS chunk has wrong size for RGB image
*) 42: tRNS chunk appeared while it was not allowed for this color type
*) 43: bKGD chunk has wrong size for palette image
*) 44: bKGD chunk has wrong size for greyscale image
*) 45: bKGD chunk has wrong size for RGB image
*) 46: value encountered in indexed image is larger than the palette size (bitdepth == 8). Is the palette too small?
*) 47: value encountered in indexed image is larger than the palette size (bitdepth < 8). Is the palette too small?
*) 48: the input data is empty. Maybe a PNG file you tried to load doesn't exist or is in the wrong path.
*) 49: jumped past memory while generating dynamic huffman tree
*) 50: jumped past memory while generating dynamic huffman tree
*) 51: jumped past memory while inflating huffman block
*) 52: jumped past memory while inflating
*) 53: size of zlib data too small
*) 55: jumped past tree while generating huffman tree, this could be when the
       tree will have more leaves than symbols after generating it out of the
       given lenghts. They call this an oversubscribed dynamic bit lengths tree in zlib.
*) 56: given output image colorType or bitDepth not supported for color conversion
*) 57: invalid CRC encountered (checking CRC can be disabled)
*) 58: invalid ADLER32 encountered (checking ADLER32 can be disabled)
*) 59: conversion to unexisting color mode or color mode conversion not supported.
*) 60: invalid window size given in the settings of the encoder (must be 0-32768)
*) 61: invalid BTYPE given in the settings of the encoder (only 0, 1 and 2 are allowed)
*) 62: conversion from non-greyscale color to greyscale color requested by encoder or decoder. LodePNG
       leaves the choice of RGB to greyscale conversion formula to the user.
*) 63: length of a chunk too long, max allowed for PNG is 2147483647 bytes per chunk (2^31-1)
*) 64: the length of the "end" symbol 256 in the Huffman tree is 0, resulting in the inability of a deflated
       block to ever contain an end code. It must be at least 1.
*) 66: the length of a text chunk keyword given to the encoder is longer than the maximum 79 bytes.
*) 67: the length of a text chunk keyword given to the encoder is smaller than the minimum 1 byte.
*) 68: tried to encode a PLTE chunk with a palette that has less than 1 or more than 256 colors

*) 77: integer overflow in buffer size happened somewhere
*) 78: file doesn't exist or couldn't be opened for reading
*) 79: file couldn't be opened for writing
*) 80: tried creating a tree for 0 symbols

8. chunks and PNG editing
-------------------------

If you want to add extra chunks to a PNG you encode, or use LodePNG for a PNG
editor that should follow the rules about handling of unknown chunks, or if you
program is able to read other types of chunks than the ones handled by LodePNG,
then that's possible with the chunk functions of LodePNG.

A PNG chunk has the following layout:

4 bytes length
4 bytes type name
length bytes data
4 bytes CRC


8.1. iterating through chunks
-----------------------------

If you have a buffer containing the PNG image data, then the first chunk (the
IHDR chunk) starts at byte number 8 of that buffer. The first 8 bytes are the
signature of the PNG and are not part of a chunk. But if you start at byte 8
then you have a chunk, and can check the following things of it.

NOTE: none of these functions check for memory buffer boundaries. To avoid
exploits, always make sure the buffer contains all the data of the chunks.
When using LodePNG_chunk_next, make sure the returned value is within the
allocated memory.

unsigned LodePNG_chunk_length(const unsigned char* chunk):

Get the length of the chunk's data. The total chunk length is this length + 12.

void LodePNG_chunk_type(char type[5], const unsigned char* chunk):
unsigned char LodePNG_chunk_type_equals(const unsigned char* chunk, const char* type):

Get the type of the chunk or compare if it's a certain type

unsigned char LodePNG_chunk_critical(const unsigned char* chunk):
unsigned char LodePNG_chunk_private(const unsigned char* chunk):
unsigned char LodePNG_chunk_safetocopy(const unsigned char* chunk):

Check if the chunk is critical in the PNG standard (only IHDR, PLTE, IDAT and IEND are).
Check if the chunk is private (public chunks are part of the standard, private ones not).
Check if the chunk is safe to copy. If it's not, then, when modifying data in a critical
chunk, unsafe to copy chunks of the old image may NOT be saved in the new one if your
program doesn't handle that type of unknown chunk.

unsigned char* LodePNG_chunk_data(unsigned char* chunk):
const unsigned char* LodePNG_chunk_data_const(const unsigned char* chunk):

Get a pointer to the start of the data of the chunk.

unsigned LodePNG_chunk_check_crc(const unsigned char* chunk):
void LodePNG_chunk_generate_crc(unsigned char* chunk):

Check if the crc is correct or generate a correct one.

unsigned char* LodePNG_chunk_next(unsigned char* chunk):
const unsigned char* LodePNG_chunk_next_const(const unsigned char* chunk):

Iterate to the next chunk. This works if you have a buffer with consecutive chunks. Note that these
functions do no boundary checking of the allocated data whatsoever, so make sure there is enough
data available in the buffer to be able to go to the next chunk.

unsigned LodePNG_append_chunk(unsigned char** out, size_t* outlength, const unsigned char* chunk):
unsigned LodePNG_create_chunk(unsigned char** out, size_t* outlength, unsigned length, const char* type, const unsigned char* data):

These functions are used to create new chunks that are appended to the data in *out that has
length *outlength. The append function appends an existing chunk to the new data. The create
function creates a new chunk with the given parameters and appends it. Type is the 4-letter
name of the chunk.


8.2. chunks in infoPng
----------------------

The LodePNG_InfoPng struct contains a struct LodePNG_UnknownChunks in it. This
struct has 3 buffers (each with size) to contain 3 types of unknown chunks:
the ones that come before the PLTE chunk, the ones that come between the PLTE
and the IDAT chunks, and the ones that come after the IDAT chunks.
It's necessary to make the distionction between these 3 cases because the PNG
standard forces to keep the ordering of unknown chunks compared to the critical
chunks, but does not force any other ordering rules.

infoPng.unknown_chunks.data[0] is the chunks before PLTE
infoPng.unknown_chunks.data[1] is the chunks after PLTE, before IDAT
infoPng.unknown_chunks.data[2] is the chunks after IDAT

The chunks in these 3 buffers can be iterated through and read by using the same
way described in the previous subchapter.

When using the decoder to decode a PNG, you can make it store all unknown chunks
if you set the option settings.rememberUnknownChunks to 1. By default, this option
is off and is 0.

The encoder will always encode unknown chunks that are stored in the infoPng. If
you need it to add a particular chunk that isn't known by LodePNG, you can use
LodePNG_append_chunk or LodePNG_create_chunk to the chunk data in
infoPng.unknown_chunks.data[x].

Chunks that are known by LodePNG should not be added in that way. E.g. to make
LodePNG add a bKGD chunk, set background_defined to true and add the correct
parameters there and LodePNG will generate the chunk.


9. compiler support
-------------------

No libraries other than the current standard C library are needed to compile
LodePNG. For the C++ version, only the standard C++ library is needed on top.
Add the files lodepng.c(pp) and lodepng.h to your project, include
lodepng.h where needed, and your program can read/write PNG files.

Use optimization! For both the encoder and decoder, compiling with the best
optimizations makes a large difference.

Make sure that LodePNG is compiled with the same compiler of the same version
and with the same settings as the rest of the program, or the interfaces with
std::vectors and std::strings in C++ can be incompatible resulting in bad things.

CHAR_BITS must be 8 or higher, because LodePNG uses unsigned chars for octets.

*) gcc and g++

LodePNG is developed in gcc so this compiler is natively supported. It gives no
warnings with compiler options "-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -ansi", with gcc and g++
version 4.5.1 on Linux.

*) Mingw and Bloodshed DevC++

The Mingw compiler (a port of gcc) used by Bloodshed DevC++ for Windows is fully
supported by LodePNG.

*) Visual Studio 2005 and Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition

Versions 20070604 up to 20080107 have been tested on VS2005 and work. Visual
studio may give warnings about 'fopen' being deprecated. A multiplatform library
can't support the proposed Visual Studio alternative however.

If you're using LodePNG in VS2005 and don't want to see the deprecated warnings,
put this on top of lodepng.h before the inclusions: #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE

*) Visual Studio 6.0

The C++ version of LodePNG was not supported by Visual Studio 6.0 because Visual
Studio 6.0 doesn't follow the C++ standard and implements it incorrectly.
The current C version of LodePNG has not been tested in VS6 but may work now.

*) Comeau C/C++

Vesion 20070107 compiles without problems on the Comeau C/C++ Online Test Drive
at http://www.comeaucomputing.com/tryitout in both C90 and C++ mode.

*) Compilers on Macintosh

LodePNG has been reported to work both with the gcc and LLVM for Macintosh, both
for C and C++.

*) Other Compilers

If you encounter problems on other compilers, I'm happy to help out make LodePNG
support the compiler if it supports the ISO C90 and C++ standard well enough and
the required modification doesn't require using non standard or less good C/C++
code or headers.


10. examples
------------

This decoder and encoder example show the most basic usage of LodePNG (using the

10.3. Decoder C example
-----------------------

This example loads the PNG from a file into a pixel buffer in 1 function call

#include "lodepng.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  unsigned error;
  unsigned char* image;
  size_t width, height;
  
  if(argc <= 1) return 0;
  
  error = LodePNG_decode32_file(&image, &width, &height, filename);
  
  //use image here
  
  free(image);
}


11. changes
-----------

The version number of LodePNG is the date of the change given in the format
yyyymmdd.

Some changes aren't backwards compatible. Those are indicated with a (!)
symbol.

*) 30 okt 2010: made decoding slightly faster
*) 26 okt 2010: (!) changed some C function and struct names (more consistent).
     Reorganized the documentation and the declaration order in the header.
*) 08 aug 2010: only changed some comments and external samples.
*) 05 jul 2010: fixed bug thanks to warnings in the new gcc version.
*) 14 mar 2010: fixed bug where too much memory was allocated for char buffers.
*) 02 sep 2008: fixed bug where it could create empty tree that linux apps could
    read by ignoring the problem but windows apps couldn't.
*) 06 jun 2008: added more error checks for out of memory cases.
*) 26 apr 2008: added a few more checks here and there to ensure more safety.
*) 06 mar 2008: crash with encoding of strings fixed
*) 02 feb 2008: support for international text chunks added (iTXt)
*) 23 jan 2008: small cleanups, and #defines to divide code in sections
*) 20 jan 2008: support for unknown chunks allowing using LodePNG for an editor.
*) 18 jan 2008: support for tIME and pHYs chunks added to encoder and decoder.
*) 17 jan 2008: ability to encode and decode compressed zTXt chunks added
    Also vareous fixes, such as in the deflate and the padding bits code.
*) 13 jan 2008: Added ability to encode Adam7-interlaced images. Improved
    filtering code of encoder.
*) 07 jan 2008: (!) changed LodePNG to use ISO C90 instead of C++. A
    C++ wrapper around this provides an interface almost identical to before.
    Having LodePNG be pure ISO C90 makes it more portable. The C and C++ code
    are together in these files but it works both for C and C++ compilers.
*) 29 dec 2007: (!) changed most integer types to unsigned int + other tweaks
*) 30 aug 2007: bug fixed which makes this Borland C++ compatible
*) 09 aug 2007: some VS2005 warnings removed again
*) 21 jul 2007: deflate code placed in new namespace separate from zlib code
*) 08 jun 2007: fixed bug with 2- and 4-bit color, and small interlaced images
*) 04 jun 2007: improved support for Visual Studio 2005: crash with accessing
    invalid std::vector element [0] fixed, and level 3 and 4 warnings removed
*) 02 jun 2007: made the encoder add a tag with version by default
*) 27 may 2007: zlib and png code separated (but still in the same file),
    simple encoder/decoder functions added for more simple usage cases
*) 19 may 2007: minor fixes, some code cleaning, new error added (error 69),
    moved some examples from here to lodepng_examples.cpp
*) 12 may 2007: palette decoding bug fixed
*) 24 apr 2007: changed the license from BSD to the zlib license
*) 11 mar 2007: very simple addition: ability to encode bKGD chunks.
*) 04 mar 2007: (!) tEXt chunk related fixes, and support for encoding
    palettized PNG images. Plus little interface change with palette and texts.
*) 03 mar 2007: Made it encode dynamic Huffman shorter  with repeat codes.
    Fixed a bug where the end code of a block had length 0 in the Huffman tree.
*) 26 feb 2007: Huffman compression with dynamic trees (BTYPE 2) now implemented
    and supported by the encoder, resulting in smaller PNGs at the output.
*) 27 jan 2007: Made the Adler-32 test faster so that a timewaste is gone.
*) 24 jan 2007: gave encoder an error interface. Added color conversion from any
    greyscale type to 8-bit greyscale with or without alpha.
*) 21 jan 2007: (!) Totally changed the interface. It allows more color types
    to convert to and is more uniform. See the manual for how it works now.
*) 07 jan 2007: Some cleanup & fixes, and a few changes over the last days:
    encode/decode custom tEXt chunks, separate classes for zlib & deflate, and
    at last made the decoder give errors for incorrect Adler32 or Crc.
*) 01 jan 2007: Fixed bug with encoding PNGs with less than 8 bits per channel.
*) 29 dec 2006: Added support for encoding images without alpha channel, and
    cleaned out code as well as making certain parts faster.
*) 28 dec 2006: Added "Settings" to the encoder.
*) 26 dec 2006: The encoder now does LZ77 encoding and produces much smaller files now.
    Removed some code duplication in the decoder. Fixed little bug in an example.
*) 09 dec 2006: (!) Placed output parameters of public functions as first parameter.
    Fixed a bug of the decoder with 16-bit per color.
*) 15 okt 2006: Changed documentation structure
*) 09 okt 2006: Encoder class added. It encodes a valid PNG image from the
    given image buffer, however for now it's not compressed.
*) 08 sep 2006: (!) Changed to interface with a Decoder class
*) 30 jul 2006: (!) LodePNG_InfoPng , width and height are now retrieved in different
    way. Renamed decodePNG to decodePNGGeneric.
*) 29 jul 2006: (!) Changed the interface: image info is now returned as a
    struct of type LodePNG::LodePNG_Info, instead of a vector, which was a bit clumsy.
*) 28 jul 2006: Cleaned the code and added new error checks.
    Corrected terminology "deflate" into "inflate".
*) 23 jun 2006: Added SDL example in the documentation in the header, this
    example allows easy debugging by displaying the PNG and its transparency.
*) 22 jun 2006: (!) Changed way to obtain error value. Added
    loadFile function for convenience. Made decodePNG32 faster.
*) 21 jun 2006: (!) Changed type of info vector to unsigned.
    Changed position of palette in info vector. Fixed an important bug that
    happened on PNGs with an uncompressed block.
*) 16 jun 2006: Internally changed unsigned into unsigned where
    needed, and performed some optimizations.
*) 07 jun 2006: (!) Renamed functions to decodePNG and placed them
    in LodePNG namespace. Changed the order of the parameters. Rewrote the
    documentation in the header. Renamed files to lodepng.cpp and lodepng.h
*) 22 apr 2006: Optimized and improved some code
*) 07 sep 2005: (!) Changed to std::vector interface
*) 12 aug 2005: Initial release
