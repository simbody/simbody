Simbody as a placeholder for Ground in the 0th slot for a

type will also be Ground. You can think of this as a Weld-like mobilizer that
connects the Ground body to the world, located at the Ground origin. The
reaction force in this mobilizer represents the total torque and force
applied by the System to Ground. This mobilizer is not available for
users -- if you want to weld something to Ground use MobilizedBody::Weld
instead.
