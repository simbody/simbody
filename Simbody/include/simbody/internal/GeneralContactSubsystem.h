/**
 * This class performs collision detection for use in contact modeling.  It manages sets
 * of bodies that can potentially interact with each other.  At each time step, it identifies
 * all the contacts between them.  It does not directly affect the behavior of the system
 * in any way.  Instead, it simply provides a service that can be used by other classes
 * to implement forces, events, contraints, etc. that are based on contacts between bodies.
 *
 * To use this class, first create a "contact set" by calling createContactSet().  A contact
 * set is a group of bodies which can interact with each other.  If you create multiple contact
 * sets, the bodies within each one will be checked for contacts with each other, but bodies in
 * different sets will not interact.
 *
 * Next, add bodies to the contact set.  Each one is represented by a ContactGeometry object
 * that describes its shape, the MoblizedBody it is attached to, and a Transform giving the location
 * of the geometry in the MobilizedBody's reference frame.
 *
 * Finally, call getContacts() to get a list of all contacts which exist between bodies in a
 * contact set.  Each Contact specifies two bodies that overlap, along with a description of the
 * contact point, such as its location and normal vector.
