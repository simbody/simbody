/** Model a compliant stop element that acts to keep a mobilizer coordinate q
within specified bounds. This force element generates no force when the
coordinate is in bounds, but when either the lower or upper bound is exceeded
it generates a generalized force opposing further violation of the bound. The
generated force is composed of a stiffness force (or torque, or generalized
force) that is linear in the violation of the bound, and dissipation that is
linear in the rate qdot.

@bug MobilityLinearStop currently works only for coordinates q whose time
derivatives qdot are just the corresponding generalized speed u. That is the
case for translational mobilities, pin, universal, and gimbal mobilizers but
not free or ball mobilizers.

<h3>Theory:</h3>
Given a mobilizer coordinate q and limits q_low and q_high, the generalized
force generated here is:
<pre>
      {           0,             q_low <= q <= q_high
  f = { min(0, -k*x*(1+d*qdot)), q > q_high, x=q-q_high (x>0, f<=0)
      { max(0, -k*x*(1-d*qdot)), q < q_low,  x=q-q_low  (x<0, f>=0)
</pre>
where k is a stiffness parameter, and d is a dissipation coefficient.

Note that dissipation occurs both during compression and expansion, but we
will never generate a "sticking" force. This is a Hunt and Crossley-like
dissipation model. It has the nice property that the damping force is zero
when you first touch the stop.
