class AssemblyCondition;

/** This Study attempts to find a configuration (set of joint coordinates q)
of a Simbody MultibodySystem that satisfies the System's position Constraints
plus optional additional assembly conditions. If successful, the final set
of q's will satisfy the constraints to within a specified tolerance. The
Assembler also supports high-performance repeated assembly (also known as
"inverse kinematics" or "tracking") where only small changes are expected
between a series of observation frames.

The complete specification for an Assembly study consists of four elements:
  - The subset of q's which may be modified by the study.
  - Limits on the allowable range of values for each q.
  - A set of assembly error conditions that \e must be satisfied.
  - A set of weighted assembly goals that are to be achieved as best we can.

By default, all q's may be modified with no range restrictions. The q's whose
value is a prescribed function of time will be set to that value, while free
q's are available for satisfying the assembly error conditions and goals. The
assembly error conditions are just the errors in the position (holonomic)
constraints that are present in the MultibodySystem and currently enabled.
(Quaternion normalization constraints will also be satisfied, but do not
generate assembly errors.) There are no default assembly goals. This is very
similar in behavior to the System's project() method except that project()
considers it an error if the constraints aren't already close to being
satisfied initially, while Assembler will attempt to satisfy them regardless,
and may take a series of increasingly desperate measures to do so.

<h2>Basic assembly:</h2>
This is the most common use of the Assembler: modify a System's given State
so that its configuration (set of generalized coordinates q) satisfies the
position-affecting Motion and Constraint objects in the System that are
currently enabled in that State. This is done to a default tolerance if you
don't provide one, and that tolerance is suitable for use with subsequent
dynamic studies that are run at their default tolerances. Although the assembly
begins from the configuration provided in the initial state, no assumption is
made about how close this initial configuration is to one that satisfies the
assembly conditions.
@code
  MultibodySystem system;
  // ... build system; get initial state

  Assembler assembler(system); // construct the Assembler study object
  try // modify state to satisfy Constraints
  {   assembler.assemble(state); }
  catch (const std::exception& exc)
  {   std::cout << "Assembly failed: " << exc.what() << std::endl; }
@endcode

<h2>Inverse kinematics (repeated assembly):</h2>
After the initial assembly done as above, an inverse kinematic study consists
of a series of assembly solutions for a sequence of small changes to the
assembly conditions. A common example is the tracking of a time series of
marker observations. Thus each "tracking" assembly computation may assume:
  - There has been no change to the problem structure.
  - The internal State is already close to the desired solution and has not
    been changed since the last tracking frame solution.

Allowable (gradual) changes between tracking frames are:
  - Time, which may affect prescribed motion or other time-dependent
    Constraints as well as time-dependent assembly conditions.
  - Weights on assembly goals. Continuous changes to goal weights are
    permitted, but changes between 0 and nonzero or between finite and
    Infinity should not be made because these are structural changes
    to the form of the problem and require reinitialization.
  - Any changes allowed by the assembly conditions currently included in this
    Assembler, for example marker location observations for the Markers
    assembly condition.

The track() method performs assembly analysis under these assumptions and can
be much faster than assemble(). Here is an outline of code that performs
repeated tracking of data from a series of observation frames, each associated
with a frame time:
@code
  MultibodySystem system;
  // ... build system; get initial state
  Assembler assembler(system); // construct the Assembler Study object
  // ... set up assembly conditions; perform initial assemble() as above;
  //     assume assembled result is in State myState.

  try // track a series of small changes to the assembly conditions
  {   for (int i=0; i < numFrames; ++i) {
          // ... update assembly conditions for frame[i]
          assembler.track(frameTime[i]);
          assembler.updateFromInternalState(myState); // update time and qs
          // ... do something with the results in myState
      }
  }
  catch (const std::exception& exc)
  {   std::cout << "Tracking failed: " << exc.what() << std::endl; }
@endcode

<h2>Optional settings:</h2>
Optional settings include:
  - Locking particular mobilizers so that their q's can't be changed.
  - Setting bounds on the acceptable range of values for some of the q's.
  - Defining additional assembly conditions.
  - Assigning assembly conditions to be errors ("needs") or weighted goals
    ("wants").

Assembly errors are specified by giving an assembly condition a weight of
Infinity. Anything with a lower weight is a goal and will be combined with all
the other goals into a single scalar objective. The built-in Constraints are
normally treated with infinite weight, but you can change them to goals instead
if you like; sometimes that can be useful as a step in getting a difficult-to-
assemble system assembled.

exactly.) You can selectively enable and disable Constraints in the
state using the ordinary Constraint::disable() and enable() methods. You

if the weight is zero they will be ignored; if Infinity they are treated
as must-satisfy assembly error conditions; any other number is used to
weight the RMS Constraint error into the scalar objective along
