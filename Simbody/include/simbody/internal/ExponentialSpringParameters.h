/** ExponentialSpringParameters is a helper class used to customize the
force-producing characteristics of an ExponentialSpringForce instance.
ExponentialSpringParameters manages all parameters that are implemented as
Stage::Topology variables. To customize any of the Topology-stage parameters
on an ExponentialSpringForce instance, you should

1) Create an ExponentialSpringParameters object. For example,

        ExponentialSpringParameters myParams;

2) Use the available 'set' methods in this class to change the parameters
of that object. For example,

        myParams.setNormalViscosity(0.25);

3) Use ExponentialSpringForce::setParameters() to alter the parameters of one
(or many) ExponentialSpringForce instances. For example,

        ExponentialSpringForce spr1, spr2;
        spr1.setParameters(myParams);
        spr2.setParameters(myParams);

4) Realize the system to Stage::Topology. When a new set of parameters is
set on an ExponentialSpringForce instance, as above in step 3, the System will
be invalidated at Stage::Topology. The System must therefore be realized at
Stage::Topology (and hence Stage::Model) before a simulation can proceed.

        system.realizeTopology();

Note that each ExponentialSpringForce instance owns its own private
ExponentialSpringParameters object. The myParams object is just used to set
the desired parameter values of the privately owned parameters object. It is
fine for objects like myParams to go out of scope or for myParams objects
allocated from the heap to be deleted.

Therefore, also note that the parameter values possessed by an
ExponentialSpringForce instance do not necessarily correspond to the values
held by an instance of this class until a call to
ExponentialSpringForce::setParameters() is made.

The default values of the parameters held by ExponentialSpringParameters
work well for typical contact interactions, but clearly may not be
appropriate for simulating many contact interactions. For example, you might
want to simulate an interaction in which very little energy is dissipated
during a contact event, in which case you'd reduce the normal viscosity and
friction spring viscosity, as well as decrease the coefficients of
friction. Valid values of the friction spring elasticity and viscosity
(kxy and cxy) can range widely (e.g., kxy = 1,000 to kxy = 1,000,000)
depending on the material properties of the objects represented by a
particular MobilizedBody and contact plane (e.g., bare feet on a yoga mat vs.
a steel bearing on a marble floor). In general, higher values of kxy and cxy
will result in smaller integration step sizes.

The default values of the parameters are expressed in units of Newtons,
meters, seconds, and kilograms; however, you may use an alternate set of
self-consistent units by re-specifying all parameters.

Finally, there are 2 parameters in this class that possess a different
status than the others. They are 1) the initial value for the static
coefficient of friction (μₛ) and 2) the initial value for the kinetic
coefficient of friction (μₖ).

These two parameters, like the others, are used to set the force-producing
characteristics of an ExponentialSpringForce instance at the beginning of a
simulation when a model is put together. And, if the initial μₛ or the
initial μₖ are changed, those new values will not be realized for an
ExponentialSpringForce instance until ExponentialSpringForce::setParameters()
on the instance is called and, further, the System is re-realized to
Stage::Topology.

Unlike the other parameters, however, there are Dynamics-stage discrete state
variables that correspond to the initial μₛ and the default μₖ. These
discrete-state versions (think of them as the instantaneous μₛ and the
instantaneous μₖ) can be changed during the course of a simulation without
having to call setParameters() and re-realize the System at Stage::Toplogy.
This functionality allows a contact plane to posses non-uniform frictional
characteristics across its surface. For example, a patch of ice on a sidewalk
could be modeled. The discrete-state versions of μₛ and μₖ (the instantaneous
versions) should NOT be changed via the ExponentialSpringParameters class, but
by setting them directly on an ExponentialSpringForce instance by calling
ExponentialSpringForce::setMuStatic() and
ExponentialSpringForce::setMuKinetic().

In summary, regarding coefficients of friction, use
ExponentialSpringParameters to establish the initial values for μₛ and μₖ;
use ExponentialSpringForce::setMuStatic() and
ExponentialSpringForce::setMuKinetic() to change μₛ and μₖ during the course
of a simulation.

    Note that pz is the displacement of the body spring station above
    (pz > 0.0) or below (pz < 0.0) the contact plane. The default values of
    the shape parameters were chosen to maximize integration step size while
    maintaining a number of constraints (e.g., the normal force should fall

    @param d0 shifts the exponential function up and down with respect to the
    contact plane. Its default value is 0.0065905 m (~7 mm above the contact
    plane). This slight upward shift reduces penetration of the body spring
    station below the contact plane. That is, unless there is an extreme
    impact event, the repulsive force applied to the body will generally be
    large enough to keep pz from going negative. There is no issue with pz
    going negative (nothing special happens); the shift just facilitates an

    indefinitely. If a body is sliding, even if cxy = 0.0, the kinetic energy
    of the body will still be dissipated because the frictional force is
    directed opposite the sliding velocity, and the elastic part of the
