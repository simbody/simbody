//==============================================================================
//                                CABLE PATH
//==============================================================================
/** This class represents the path of a frictionless cable from an origin point
fixed to a body, through via points and over geometric obstacles fixed to other
bodies, to a final termination point. The cable ends are attached at the origin
and termination points while the cable is free to slide through the via points
and along the obstacle surfaces. The cable follows a geodesic curve (usually
the shortest path) over each surface.

During initialization, if there is more than one possible geodesic over a
surface, or if a straight line path would miss the surface altogether, we'll
take the shortest route unless the user has provided a "near point" on the
surface. In that case whichever of the possible path segments runs closest to
the near point is chosen. During continuation, only local path movement is
allowed so the path segment will not flip from one side to the other once it
has been initialized, even if that means it does not follow the shortest
possible geodesic. The near point is ignored during continuation.

Note that a %CablePath is a geometric object, not a force or constraint
element. That is, a %CablePath alone will not influence the behavior of a
simulation. However, forces and constraint elements can be constructed that make
use of a %CablePath to generate forces. For an example, see CableSpring.

The auxiliary class CableObstacle and its subclasses are used to specify the
via points and obstacles that affect a particular %CablePath. %CablePath
objects must be registered with a CablePathSubsystem which manages their
runtime evaluation.

<h3>Notation</h3>

For convenience, we include the origin and termination points as obstacles,
with the origin being obstacle zero, followed by m via point and surface
obstacles numbered 1 to m, followed by the termination point as obstacle t=m+1.
Every obstacle is represented by two "contact points", P and Q, which we'll
number Pi and Qi for obstacle i. The obstacles are
separated by straight-line segments running from Qi-1 to Pi. Starting at
the origin Q0, the path first touches the surface of obstacle 1 at P1,
travels over the surface to Q1, and then leaves the surface towards the
termination point Pt. That is, Pi's path coordinate must be less than Qi's.
The segment from P to Q is a geodesic over the surface. For via points,
points P and Q are in the same location but there are two different tangents
associated with them in the incoming and outgoing straight-line directions.
For the origin obstacle, only point Q is relevant and for the termination
obstacle only point P is relevant.

The result is saved in the supplied State which may then be used as the

a good starting solution, making use of any hints that have been
supplied with the obstacles. This is substantially different (and much more
time consuming) than the method used during a simulation, which always starts
with the previous solution and is intentionally limited to finding a nearby
solution.

The initial solution consists of both (a) which of the surface obstacles are
active, and (b) the intersection of the cable with the active obstacles and
the path taken by the cable over those obstacles (a geodesic curve). For
inactive surface obstacles we determine the closest point between the obstacles
and the path; that point will be tracked continuously during a simulation. The
user-supplied ordering and near points are respected. The
cable length and length rate of change are available immediately after this
