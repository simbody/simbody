/** This constraint represents a \e bilateral connection between an edge
on one body and a non-parallel edge on another.

On construction you may choose whether the connection enforces non-slipping
(which we'll call "rolling" here for consistency with other constraints);
otherwise the lines will slip against each other. There is always one position
(holonomic) constraint equation: the lines containing the edges must touch at
some point. That leaves the edges with five unconstrained degrees of freedom
(dofs) to take on any relative orientation and to be touching at any point on
their lengths. Optionally, there are also two velocity (nonholonomic) constraint
equations that prevent relative slip between the edges. In that case there can
be five position dofs but only three unconstrained velocity dofs.

Note that this is a bilateral, unconditional connection and will push or pull
as necessary to keep the lines in contact. If rolling is being enforced then
whatever tangential forces are necessary to keep the lines from slipping
will be generated, regardless of the normal force. These constraints can form
the basis for unilateral edge-edge contact with Coulomb friction, but additional
conditions must be added to determine when they are active.

There are two mobilized bodies involved, we'll call them F and B. Either or both
bodies can move or either can be Ground; however, we will orient the signs in
our calculations so that we can think of F as "fixed"; the contact normal
points towards the "outside" of F and towards the "inside" of B. That means
that if we translate B relative to F in the direction of the normal, the
signed distance between them increases (separation increases or penetration
decreases). That allows us to say, for example, that a positive position error
means separation, that a negative normal velocity error means impact, and that
a positive force (negative multiplier) means compression.

Each edge E is defined by a center point P, edge direction d, and exterior
"space" direction s used to define the sign convention. The s direction
points outward from the solid whose two faces meet to form E, along the
midplane between those two faces. We also ask for the edge half-lengths
which can be used for visualization and for detecting separation caused by
slipping of the end of an edge, but don't actually affect the constraint here
which works on the lines containing the edges.

F has an edge Ef attached to it with center point Pf, direction df, half length
hf, and outward normal sf. B has edge Eb=(Pb,db,hb,sb). The vector between the
defining center points is p_PfPb=Pb-Pf, oriented from Ef's center point to Bf's
center point. The contact normal n will be a unit vector aligned with
w=df X db, with n=sign*w/||w||. Sign is chosen by examining the dot product
of w with sf and sb so that translating Eb along +n would increase the signed
distance between the edges.

To locate the contact point Co, we want to find the closest points Qf and Qb
on each line, with Qf=Pf + tf*df and Qb=Pb + tb*db for some parameters tf and
tb. So we are looking for the solution of this equation:
<pre>
    (1) Pf + tf*df + r*n = Pb + tb*db
</pre>
where r is the separation distance and n is the contact normal defined above.
These are three linear equations in three unknowns, saying that we can get from
the closest point Qf on Ef to the closest point Qb on Eb by moving up the
contact normal direction from Qf to Qb by a signed distance r (that is, if r<0
then we are moving \e down the contact normal). Since n is perpendicular to both
df and db, we can dot both sides of Eqn. (1) with n to get
<pre>
    (2) (Pf + r*n) . n = Pb . n
==>     r*(n.n) = (Pb - Pf) . n
==> (3) r = (Pb - Pf) . n           [since n is a unit vector]
</pre>
Similarly, we can dot with n X db and n X df to solve for tf and tb, resp.
<pre>
    (4) (Pf + tf*df) . (n X db) = Pb . (n X db)
==>     tf * (df . (n X db)) = (Pb - Pf) . (n X db)

             (Pb-Pf).(n X db)
==> (5) tf = ----------------       [can use wXdb here instead of nXdb]
              df . (n X db)
</pre> and <pre>
    (6) Pf . (n X df) = (Pb + tb*db) . (n X df)
==>     tb * (db . (n X df)) = (Pf - Pb) . (n X df)

               (Pb-Pf).(n X df)
==> (7) tb = - ----------------     [can use wXdf here instead of nXdf]
                db . (n X df)
</pre>

Then the position constraint we want to enforce is r==0, requiring the lines
to touch at their closest points. If the constraint were perfectly enforced,
then the contact point Co would be at the same location as the two
closest points. Since it won't be enforced perfectly, we'll put the contact
point at the midpoint between Qf and Qb, so Co=(Qf+Qb)/2. The exact position
of Co does not matter for the position constraint, because the normal force
is applied along the line including Qf and Qb. However, it will matter (a
little) for the friction constraints.

For any given pose, we will define a contact frame C with origin Co whose z
axis Cz=n, Cx=df, Cy=n X df. The instantaneous contact frame in Ground is
available as the transform X_GC.

The contact constraints here are enforced by a normal multiplier acting along
Cz, and optionally two tangential multipliers acting along Cx and Cy
respectively. Together these three multipliers can be interpreted as a force
expressed in frame C, and applied equal and opposite to bodies F and B at
their material points coincident with contact point Co.

The assembly condition is the same as the position constraint: the two lines
must meet at some point. No attempt is made to force the contact point to be
within the two edges; we only make the lines containing the edges touch
somewhere. There is no assembly
condition for the tangential constraints since they do not restrict the
allowable pose during assembly. **/

/** @name                       Construction
Methods in this section refer both to constructors, and to methods that can
be used to set or change contruction (Topology-stage) parameters; these
specify the values assigned by default to the corresponding state variables.
Note:
  - Changing one of these default parameters invalidates the containing
    System's topology, meaning that realizeTopology() will have to be called
    and a new State obtained before subsequent use.
  - The set...() methods return a reference to "this" %LineOnLineContact
    element (in the manner of an assignment operator) so they can be chained in
    a single expression.

The default parameters can be overridden in any given State, and modified
without affecting Topology; see the "Runtime Changes" section below. **/

    This Transform X_FEf defines the location and direction of the edge Ef
    on \a mobod_F, measured from and expressed in F. The frame origin is the

    from the polygonal solid for which Ef is an edge, midway between the two
    faces whose intersection defines the edge. This parameter provides the edge
    frame that will be present in a default State; you can modify it later in
    any particular State.
@param      defaultHalfLengthF
    This is the half-length hf of edge Ef. The line segment representing the
    edge thus runs from Pf-hf*df to Pf+hf*df. This parameter provides the

    frame that will be present in a default State; you can modify it later in

These refer to Position-stage discrete state variables that determine the line

If these are not set explicitly, the parameters are set to those provided in the
constructor or via the correponding setDefault...() methods.
Note:
  - Changing one of these parameters invalidates the given State's
    Stage::Position, meaning that the State's stage will be no higher than
    Stage::Time after the parameter change. That ensures that position
    constraint errors will be recalculated before they are used.
  - The set...() methods here return a const reference to "this"
    %LineOnLineContact element (in the manner of an assignment operator,
