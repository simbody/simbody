sign convention is opposite for constraint forces, so the power calculation
requires negating the constraint forces.

For any non-working %Constraint, power should always be within machine
precision of zero. This is a very useful test when debugging new Constraints.
For working Constraints, you can calculate work done as the time integral of 
the power. Then if you embed the %Constraint in an otherwise conservative
system, the sum of system potential and kinetic energy, minus the work done
by this constraint, should be constant to within integration accuracy.
Power and work here are signed quantities with positive sign meaning that
the %Constraint is adding energy to the system and negative meaning it is 
removing energy from the system. 

Computational cost here is low because the forces and velocities are already
known. Only the dot product need be computed, at a cost of about

 *
 * @warning
 * Do not use this constraint to \e align the vectors, that is for angles near 
 * 0 or +/- Pi; performance will noticeably degrade within a few degrees of 
 * these limits and numerical integration will eventually fail at the limits.
 * 
 * If you want to enforce that two axes are aligned with one another (that

 * equations since the only remaining rotation is about the common axis. (That 
 * is, two rotational degrees of freedom are removed; that can't be done with 
 * one constraint equation -- the situation is analogous to the inability of
 * a Rod (distance) constraint to keep two points at 0 distance.) Instead,
 * you can use two ConstantAngle constraints on pairs of vectors perpendicular 
 * to the aligned ones, so that each ConstantAngle is set to the optimal 90 degrees.
 * 
 * This constraint is enforced by an internal scalar torque applied equal and
 * opposite on each body, about the mutual perpendicular to the two vectors.
