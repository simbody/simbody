//==============================================================================
/** A %Motion object belongs to a particular MobilizedBody and prescribes how 
the associated motion is to be calculated. 

%Motions can provide functionality similar to some constraints, but are much 
more efficient. There are two independent aspects of prescribed motion:
 - at what level is the motion driven (low to high: acceleration, velocity, 
   or position), and 
 - how is the motion at that level specified. 

Levels lower than the driven level are also driven; higher levels are free and
determined by integration or other solution method.

Concrete %Motion objects derived from the base class provide specialized 
functionality, such as prescribing the mobilizer motion as a function of time. 
The specialized functionality may be enabled and disabled at run time, with 
motion determined dynamically if the %Motion object is disabled.

For mobilizers with more than one mobility, the associated %Motion controls 
\e all the mobilities and moreover they are all driven at the same level and by
the same method. Using MobilizedBody::lock() temporarily overrides the 
%Motion associated with that mobilizer.

<h3>Details</h3>

This table shows all the possible ways in which mobilizer motion can be
determined, based on the %Motion level and method. The default is that we
determine motion at the acceleration level from forces, with velocity and 
position calculated by integrating the acceleration.

the same as specifying velocity as Discrete and specifying velocity as Zero is 
the same as specifying position as Discrete.
