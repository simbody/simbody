//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/** This AssemblyCondition specifies a correspondence between stations on
mobilized bodies ("markers") and fixed ground-frame locations ("observations").
The idea is to adjust the q's so that each marker is located close to its
corresponding observation. This is normally used as a goal since we don't
expect a perfect fit, but you can use these as a set of assembly error
conditions if there are enough degrees of freedom to achieve a near-perfect
solution.

Markers are defined one at a time and assigned sequential marker index values
of type Markers::MarkerIx. They may optionally be given unique, case-sensitive
names, and we will keep a map from name to MarkerIx. A default name will be
assigned if none is given. A weight is assigned to every marker, with default
weight=1. We do not expect that all the markers will be used; markers with
weights of zero will not be included in the study, nor will markers for which
no observation is given.

Once specified, the marker definitions do not change during a series of inverse
kinematic (tracking) steps. The observations, on the other hand, are expected
to come from a time series of experimental measurements of marker locations and
will be different at every step. They typically come from a file organized by
"frame", meaning an observation time and a set of observed locations, one per
marker, corresponding to that time. During initial setup, the number of
observations per frame and their correspondence to the defined markers is
specified. They can be in any order, may skip some markers, and may include
data for markers that are not defined. However, once initialized each frame
must supply the same information in the same order. Data for an unobserved
marker can be provided as NaN in which case it will be ignored in that frame.
The frame time is supplied to the track() method which initiates assembly for
a frame.

Observation-marker correspondence maps a ObservationIx to a unique MarkerIx.
By default, we'll expect to get an observation for each marker and that the
observation order and the marker order are the same, i.e.
ObservationIx==MarkerIx for every marker. However, you can instead define
observation/marker correspondence yourself, (\e after all markers have been
defined), via one of the defineObservationOrder() methods. This is done by
supplying an array of MarkerIx values, or an array of Marker names, with the
array elements ordered by ObservationIx. Any invalid marker index or
unrecognized marker name means we will ignore values provide for that
observation; similarly, any markers whose index or name is not specified at
all will be ignored.
