/** Six mobilities -- arbitrary relative motion modeled as x-y-z translation
followed by an x-y-z body-fixed Euler angle sequence, though with a
singularity when the middle angle is +/- 90 degrees. Use MobilizedBody::Free
for a similar six-dof joint that is free of singularities.

The six generalized coordinates q are defined q={qx,qy,qz,px,py,pz} where the
first three coordinates are the rotation angles and the last three are the
Cartesian translations. Note that we follow the usual Simbody convention of
having the rotational coordinates precede the translational ones; that does
not imply any particular order of operations. In fact, as a sequence this
mobilizer should be thought of as first translating the M frame by a vector
p_FM=[px,py,pz] (expressed in F), then reorienting M about its new origin
location using the rotation angles. In the reference configuration where q=0,
the F and M frames are aligned and their origins coincident (Mo=Fo). The
convention used here exactly matches the convention used by the force element
Force::LinearBushing which infers an identical set of coordinates to express the
relative pose of its two connected frames (also called F and M).

The first three generalized coordinates q should be interpreted as a series of
rotation angles in radians: q[0]=qx is a rotation about the Mx (=Fx) axis, then
q[1]=qy is a rotation about the now-rotated My axis, and then q[2]=qz is a
rotation about the now twice-rotated Mz axis. These rotations do not affect the
location of M's origin point Mo. The generalized speeds u for the %Bushing
mobilizer are just the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates, that is,
u=qdot={qxdot,qydot,qzdot,vx,vy,vz}, where qxdot=d/dt qx, etc. and
v_FM=[vx,vy,vz]=d/dt p_FM is the velocity of Mo measured and expressed in frame
F. Note that this is different than the choice of generalized speeds used for
MobilizedBody::Free, where the angular velocity vector w_FM is used as the three
rotational generalized speeds instead of Euler angle derivatives. (Euler angle
derivatives are \e not the same as angular velocity, except when q=0.)

While this mobilizer provides arbitrary orientation, the Euler angle derivatives
are singular when q[1] (qy, the middle rotation) is near +/- Pi/2. That means
you should not attempt to do any dynamics in that configuration; if you can't
be sure the motion will remain away from that region, you should use a
MobilizedBody::Free instead, which uses quaternions to ensure singularity-free
rotation.

Here is another way to describe the meaning of a %Bushing mobilizer: except
for the ordering of the generalized coordinates, a %Bushing between frames F
on parent body P and frame M on child body B is exactly equivalent to a
translation (Cartesian) mobilizer between F and a massless body B0, followed by
a series of three pin joints using two massless intermediate bodies B1 and B2.
The first pin joint rotates about the common B0x(=Fx) and B1x axes. The second
rotates about the common B1y and B2y axes. The last one rotates about the common
B2z and Mz axes. Other than performance (which is somewhat better if you use the
%Bushing since there are fewer bodies), the translation+pins+intermediate
bodies system generates exactly the same mobility as the %Bushing, but with
coordinates q={px,py,pz,qx,qy,qz} (flipped from the %Bushing coordinate
ordering).
