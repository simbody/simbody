//==============================================================================

/** (Advanced) This is the underlying constraint for unilateral contact with
friction but must be combined with contact and friction conditions. This
enforces the same normal condition as Constraint::PointInPlane but also adds
two velocity-level no-slip constraints. Thus there are three
constraints, one position (holonomic) constraint and two velocity
(nonholonomic) constraints. Note that this is a bilateral
constraint and will push or pull as necessary to keep the point in contact
with the plane, and that sticking is enforced regardless of the amount of
normal force being generated. If you want to make this unilateral, you must
handle switching it on and off separately; when this constraint is enabled it
always enforces the contact and no-slip conditions.

There are two mobilized bodies involved. MobiliedBody S, the plane "surface"
body, has a plane P fixed to it, with the plane defined by a frame P given
relative to body S by the transform X_SP. MobiliedBody B, the "follower" body
has a station point F (a vertex) fixed to it, given with respect to body B at
location p_BF. The coordinate axes of the plane frame P (fixed in S) are used
for parameterization of the %Constraint. The z direction Pz of that frame is the
plane normal; the Px,Py directions are used to express the tangential velocity;
the P frame origin Po provides the height h=dot(Po,Pz) of the plane
over the surface body's origin in the direction of the plane normal Pz.

The position constraint equation for contact enforces that the follower point F
must always be in the plane P, that is, pz_PF=p_PF[2]=0, or equivalently <pre>
    (1) perr = pz_PF = dot(p_SF,Pz)-h
</pre>
That constraint equation is enforced by an internal
(non-working) scalar force acting at the spatial location of the follower point,
directed along the plane normal, and equal and opposite on the two bodies at F
on B and at the instantaneously coincident point p_SF on S. Because position
constraints are not enforced perfectly, contact will occur slightly above or
slightly below the plane surface, wherever the follower point is.

The two velocity constraint equations enforce that the follower point has no
relative tangential velocity when measured in the plane frame P, that is we
want to enforce vx_PF=vy_PF=0. The time derivative of the normal constraint is
also enforced at the velocity level so we have vz_PF=0. Taken together the
velocity-level constraints are just <pre>
    (2) verr = v_PF = ~R_SP * v_SF
</pre>
Equation (2) is the same as the velocity-level constraints for a ball joint
between frame P on S and point F on B. The acceleration-level constraints are
just the time derivative of (2), i.e. <pre>
    (3) aerr = a_PF = ~R_SP * a_SF
</pre>
The assembly condition is that the follower point must be in the plane; there
is no assembly condition in the tangential direction since those constraints
are at the velocity level only. **/

Methods in this section refer both to constructors, and to methods that can
be used to set or change construction (Topology-stage) parameters; these
specify the values assigned by default to the corresponding state variables.
Note:
  - Changing one of these default parameters invalidates the containing
    System's topology, meaning that realizeTopology() will have to be called
    and a new State obtained before subsequent use.
  - The set...() methods return a reference to "this" %PointOnPlaneContact

These refer to Position-stage discrete state variables that determine the sphere
and plane parameters to be used to calculate constraint forces from a given
State object. If these are not set explicitly, the parameters are set to those
provided in the constructor or via the corresponding setDefault...() methods.
Note:
  - Changing one of these parameters invalidates the given State's
    Stage::Position, meaning that the State's stage will be no higher than
    Stage::Time after the parameter change. That ensures that position
    constraint errors will be recalculated before they are used.
  - The set...() methods here return a const reference to "this"
    %SphereOnPlaneContact element (in the manner of an assignment operator,
    except read-only) so they can be chained in a single expression. **/
