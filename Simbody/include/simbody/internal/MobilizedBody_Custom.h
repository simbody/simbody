//==============================================================================
/** The handle class MobilizedBody::Custom (dataless) and its companion class
MobilizedBody::Custom::Implementation can be used together to define new
MobilizedBody types with arbitrary properties. To use it, create a class that
extends MobilizedBody::Custom::Implementation. You can then create an instance
of it and pass it to the MobilizedBody::Custom constructor:

@code
MobilizedBody::Custom myMobilizedBody(new MyMobilizedBodyImplementation(args));
@endcode
("args" here and below stands for whatever arguments are needed for your
particular mobilizer; it isn't meant literally.)

Alternatively, you can also create a new Handle class which is a subclass of
MobilizedBody::Custom and which creates the Implementation itself in its
constructors.
@code
class MyMobilizedBody : public MobilizedBody::Custom {
public:
  MyMobilizedBody(args)
  :   MobilizedBody::Custom(new MyMobilizedBodyImplementation(args)) {}
};
@endcode

This allows an end user to simply write
@code
MyMobilizedBody(args);
@endcode

and not worry about implementation classes or creating objects on the heap.
If you do this, your MobilizedBody::Custom subclass must not have any data
members or virtual methods. If it does, it will not work correctly. Instead,
store all data in the Implementation subclass.
