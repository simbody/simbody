//==============================================================================
/** This subsystem tracks the paths of massless, frictionless cables that take
the shortest route between two distant points of a multibody system, passing
smoothly over geometric obstacles that are attached to intermediate bodies.
The calculated path will consist of a series of straight line segments
between obstacles, and geodesics over the obstacles.

Force elements defined elsewhere may make use of cable paths to apply forces
to the system, by calculating a uniform tension in the cable that may depend
on the cable kinematics calculated here. Cable kinematics includes the path,
the cable length, and the cable "rate", defined as the time derivative of
length. The path and length are available at Position stage, the rate is
available at Velocity stage.

During construction, one or more CablePath objects are defined by giving for
each CablePath an origin and end point and an ordered set of geometric
obstacles represented either by surfaces or "via" points. Via points are like
frictionless eyelets that the cable must pass through and can generate forces
in any direction perpendicular to the cable; surfaces are one-sided and can
only apply positive forces to the cable. Thus the cable path does not
necessarily touch all the obstacles; the obstacles that it does touch are
called the "active" obstacles. Via points are always active.

Every obstacle and point is rigidly fixed to Ground or some moving body of
the multibody system, with its pose or station point provided. Any number of
obstacles may be placed on one body. **/
