/** A low-accuracy, high performance, velocity-level time stepper for
models containing unilateral rigid contacts or other conditional constraints.

At each step, this TimeStepper determines which subset of the multibody system's
conditional constraints may affect behavior; those are called "proximal"
constraints. It then formulates the resulting
equations and invokes an ImpulseSolver to find constraint-space impulses that
solve the constraint equations and satisfy all the constraint inequalities.
Generally there are multiple solutions possible, and different ImpulseSolver
objects use different criteria.

A variety of options are available for different methods of handling impacts,
to facilitate comparison of methods. For production, we recommend using the
default options.

    ratio of velocities; this is more commonly used in other packages and can be
    somewhat faster, but may exhibit blatantly nonphysical behavior such as
    energy gain during an impact. Poisson and Newton are equivalent in most
