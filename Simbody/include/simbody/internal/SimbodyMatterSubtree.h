/** A SimbodyMatterSubtree is a view of a connected subgraph of the tree of
mobilized bodies in a SimbodyMatterSubsystem. It is used to perform kinematic
operations on the subgraph to facilitate the handling of constraints, which
typically involve only small subgraphs.

A SimbodyMatterSubtree is characterized by a single ancestor body A and a set
of terminal mobilized bodies T={Ti}, where A is the outmost body that is on
the inboard path of each Ti. Note that a SimbodyMatterSubtree's "terminal"
bodies do not have to be terminal in the full tree. The SimbodyMatterSubtree
includes T and all "branch" mobilized bodies B={Bij} found on any path from a
Ti to A, and A itself which serves as Ground. A may be one of the terminal
bodies. A's mobilizer is *not* part of the SimbodyMatterSubtree. The path
from Ti to A is called the ith branch of the SimbodyMatterSubtree; branches
can overlap.

Each body in the SimbodyMatterSubtree is assigned an index called a
SubtreeBodyIndex, with the Ancestor being SubtreeBodyIndex 0 and other ids
assigned such that ids increase going outwards along a branch. Maps are kept
in the SimbodyMatterSubtree object to track its relationship to the full tree.

A SimbodyMatterSubtree can be constructed at Topology stage and needed ones
can thus be precalculated and stored in the SimbodyMatterSubsystem Topology
Cache (i.e., in the System not the State). Calculations done on the
SimbodyMatterSubtree, on the other hand, require further state information
and cannot be stored as part of the System. For those, we define a companion
class below called SimbodyMatterSubtreeResults.

A SimbodyMatterSubtreeResults object is initialized at Model stage, at which
point we can determine the mobilities u and generalized coordinates q. These
are assigned SubtreeUIndex's and SubtreeQIndex's in the same order that the
SimbodyMatterSubtree bodies are numbered. Maps are kept in the
SimbodyMatterSubtreeResults object to track the relationship between the
SimbodyMatterSubtree mobilities and those in the full tree.

Note that SimbodyMatterSubtree operations are elaborate \e operators, not
\e responses. That means the results are not stored in the State, but rather
in the private SimbodyMatterSubtreeResults objects.

Operators here perform kinematic operations based on perturbations of the
global System State values. The supported perturbations are:
  General
  1a same as global System state (except answers are in A rather than G)
  1b all mobility variables set
  2  all mobility variables from 1a or 1b, except for one which is perturbed
     (q,u,udot)

  Linear
  3  all mobility variables are zero (u,udot)
  4  all mobility variables are zero *again*, except for one which is 1
     (u,udot)
Steps 1 and 2 are designed to work together, as are 3 and 4: first evaluate
nominal kinematics; then perturb. **/
