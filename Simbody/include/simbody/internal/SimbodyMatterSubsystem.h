/** This subsystem contains the bodies ("matter") in the multibody system,
the mobilizers (joints) that define the generalized coordinates used to 
represent the motion of those bodies, and constraints that must be satisfied
by the values of those coordinates.

There are many methods in the API for this class. For whole-system information
and calculations, the methods here are the right ones to use. For information
associated with individual objects contained in the subsystem, such as 
MobilizedBody and Constraint objects, it is generally easier to obtain the
information through the contained objects' APIs instead.

This class is is a "handle" containing only an opaque reference to the 
underlying implementation class.

<h3>Theory discussion</h3>
The bodies, mobilizers, and constraints are represented mathematically with
the following set of equations:
<pre>
                     qdot = N u                 Kinematic differential eqns.
                     zdot = zdot(t,q,u,z)       Auxiliary states

         M udot + ~G mult = f(t,q,u,z)          Equations of motion
         G udot           = b(t,q,u) 

                 where

          [P]    [bp]
        G=[V]  b=[bv]  f = T + ~J*(F-C)
          [A]    [ba]

          pdotdot = P udot - bp(t,q,u) = 0      Acceleration constraints
             vdot = V udot - bv(t,q,u) = 0
    a(t,q,u,udot) = A udot - ba(t,q,u) = 0
          
                   pdot = P u - c(t,q) = 0      Velocity constraints
                              v(t,q,u) = 0

                                p(t,q) = 0      Position constraints
                                  n(q) = 0      Normalization constraints
</pre>
where M(q) is the mass matrix, G(t,q,u) the acceleration constraint matrix, 
C(q,u) the coriolis and gyroscopic forces, T is user-applied joint mobility
forces, F is user-applied body forces and torques and gravity. J(q) is the
%System Jacobian (partial velocity matrix) whose transpose ~J maps spatial
forces to joint mobility forces. p(t,q) are the holonomic (position) 
constraints, v(t,q,u) the non-holonomic (velocity) constraints, and 
a(t,q,u,udot) the acceleration-only constraints, which must be linear in udot, 
with A(t,q,u) the coefficient matrix for a(). pdot, pdotdot are obtained by 
differentiation of p(), vdot by differentiation of v(). P(t,q)=Dpdot/Du 
(yes, that's u, not q -- we can get Pq=Dp/Dq when we need it as Pq=P*N^-1) and
V(t,q,u)=Dv/Du. (We use capital "D" to indicate partial derivative.) n(q) is 
the set of quaternion normalization constraints, which exist only at the 
position level and are uncoupled from everything else.

We calculate the constraint multipliers like this:
<pre>
          G M^-1 ~G mult = G udot0 - b
          where    udot0 = M^-1 f
</pre>
using the pseudo inverse of G M^-1 ~G to give a least squares solution for
mult: mult = pinv(G M^-1 ~G)(G M^-1 f - b). Then the real udot is
udot = udot0 - udotC, with udotC = M^-1 ~G mult. Note: M^-1* is an
O(n) operator that provides the desired result; it <em>does not</em> require
forming or factoring M.

NOTE: only the following constraint matrices have to be formed and factored:
<pre>
   [G M^-1 ~G]   to calculate multipliers

   [P N^-1]      for projection onto position manifold (a.k.a. Pq)

   [ P ]         for projection onto velocity manifold
   [ V ]  
</pre>

When working in a weighted norm with weights W on the state variables and
weights T (1/tolerance) on the constraint errors, the matrices we need are
actually [Tp Pq Wq^-1], [Tpv [P;V] Wu^-1], etc. with T and W diagonal
weighting matrices. These can then be used to find least squares solutions
in the weighted norms.

In many cases these matrices consist of decoupled blocks which can
be solved independently. (TODO: take advantage of that whenever possible
to solve a set of smaller systems rather than one large one.) Also, in the
majority of biosimulation applications we are likely to have only holonomic
(position) constraints, so there is no V or A and G=P is the whole story.

/** @name         System and Task Space Kinematic Jacobian Operators 

The system kinematic Jacobian maps between mobility space (generalized speeds 
and generalized forces) and Cartesian body space (mobilized body frame spatial 
velocities and spatial forces). A task space Jacobian maps between mobility 
space and a specified set of task points or frames fixed to a subset of the 
bodies, and generally located away from the body frame. A task space Jacobian
J can be used to construct various task space matrices such as the task space 
compliance matrix J M^-1 ~J or its inverse, the task space (or operational
space) inertia matrix. 

The system Jacobian J(q) maps n generalized speeds u to spatial velocities V of 
each of the nb mobilized bodies (including Ground), measured at the body frame 
origin relative to Ground, and expressed in the Ground frame. The transpose ~J 
of this matrix maps nb spatial forces to n generalized forces, where the spatial
forces are applied at the body frame origin and expressed in Ground. Similarly, 
task space Jacobians map from n generalized speeds to nt task frame spatial 
velocities (expressed in Ground), and transposed task space Jacobians map 
between task frame spatial forces (or impulses), expressed in Ground, and 
generalized forces (or generalized impulses).

Simbody provides fast O(n) methods ("operators") that can form matrix-vector
products like J*u or ~J*F without forming J. The "bias" term Jdot*u (also known
as the Coriolis acceleration) is also available; this arises when working at
the acceleration level because d/dt J*u = J*udot+Jdot*u (where dot means time
derivative). The computational cost of these operators is O(n+nt) so it is 
\e much more efficient to work with a group of tasks simultaneously than to 
process one at a time, which would have complexity O(n*nt). Alternatively, we 
provide methods that will return all or part of J explicitly; in general it 
is \e much more efficient computationally to work with the O(n) matrix-vector 
multiply operators rather than to form explicit matrices and then perform O(n^2) 
matrix-vector products. Performance estimates are given with each method so that
you can determine which methods to use. If you can, you should use the O(n) 
methods -- it is a good habit to get into when using an O(n) multibody code like
Simbody!

Note that the Jacobian is associated with an expressed-in frame for the
velocity or force vector and a designated station (point) on each body. We 
always use the Ground frame for Jacobians. For the system Jacobian, the body 
origin is always the designated station; for task Jacobians different stations
may be specified. We provide three different sets of methods for working with
    - the full %System Jacobian: J, nb X n 6-vectors (or 6*nb X n scalars)
    - the Station Jacobian for a set of nt task stations (points): JS, nt rows 
      of n 3-vectors (or a 3*nt X n Matrix of scalars)
    - the Frame Jacobian for a set of nt task frames fixed to a body: JF, nt 
      rows of n 6-vectors (or a 6*nt X n Matrix of scalars)

The rotational part of a Jacobian is the same for any frame fixed to the same 
body. So for Frame Jacobians you need specify only a station on the body (the 
frame's origin point). That means if you want a 3*nt X n Orientation Jacobian, 
you can obtain it from alternate rows of a Frame Jacobian. Using the above 
terminology, the complete %System Jacobian is a Frame Jacobian for which the 
task frames are the body frames, with each MobilizedBody appearing only once 
and in order of MobilizedBodyIndex (starting with Ground). 

It is acceptable for the same body to appear more than once in a list of tasks;
these are likely to conflict but that can be dealt with elsewhere. **/

/**@{**/

/** Calculate the product of the %System kinematic Jacobian J (also known as the 
partial velocity matrix) and a mobility-space vector u in O(n) time. If the 
vector u is a set of generalized speeds, then this produces the body spatial 
velocities that result from those generalized speeds. That is, the result is 
V_GB = J*u where V_GB[i] is the spatial velocity of the i'th body's body frame 
origin (in Ground) that results from the given set of generalized speeds. 

@param[in]      state
    A State compatible with this System that has already been realized to
    Stage::Position.
@param[in]      u
    A mobility-space Vector, such as a set of generalized speeds. The length
    and order must match the mobilities of this system (that is n, the number
    of generalized speeds u, \e not nq, the number of generalized 
    coordinates q).
@param[out]     Ju
    This is the product V=J*u as described above. Each element is a spatial
    vector, one per mobilized body, to be indexed by MobilizedBodyIndex.
    If the input vector is a set of generalized speeds u, then the results
    are nb spatial velocities V_GBi (that is, a pair of vectors w_GBi and v_GBi 
    giving angular and linear velocity). Note that Ground is body 0 so the 0th 
    element V_GB0=V_GG=Ju[0] is always zero on return.

The kinematic Jacobian (partial velocity matrix) J is defined as follows:
<pre>
      partial(V)                                 T                        T
  J = ----------, V = [V_GB0 V_GB1 ... V_GB nb-1] ,  u = [u0 u1 ... u n-1]
      partial(u)
</pre>
Thus the element J(i,j)=partial(V_GBi)/partial(uj) (each element of J is a
spatial vector). The transpose of this matrix maps spatial forces to 
generalized forces; see multiplyBySystemJacobianTranspose().

Note that we're using "monogram" notation for the spatial velocities, where
<pre>
            G Bi
    V_GBi =  V
</pre>
the spatial velocity of body i's body frame Bi (at its origin), measured and
expressed in the Ground frame G.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
This is a very fast operator, costing about 12*(nb+n) flops, where nb is the
number of bodies and n the number of mobilities (degrees of freedom) u. In 
contrast, even if you have already calculated the entire nbXnX6 matrix J, the 
multiplication J*u would cost 12*nb*n flops. As an example, for a 20 body 
system with a free flying base and 19 pin joints (25 dofs altogether), this 
method takes 12*(20+25)=540 flops while the explicit matrix-vector multiply 
would take 12*20*25=6000 flops. So this method is already >10X faster for 
that small system; for larger systems the difference grows rapidly.

<h3>Theory</h3>
The spatial velocity V_GBi of each body i can be obtained from the generalized
speeds u by V = {V_GBi} = J*u. Taking the time derivative in G gives
<pre>
    A = d/dt V = {A_GBi} = J*udot + JDot*u
</pre>
where JDot=JDot(q,u). This method returns JDot*u, which depends only on 
configuration q and speeds u. Note that the same u is used to calculate JDot, 
which is linear in u, so this term is quadratic in u.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This method simply extracts the total Coriolis acceleration for each body that
is already available in the \a state cache so there is no computation done
here.

/** Calculate the product of the transposed kinematic Jacobian ~J (==J^T) and
a vector F_G of spatial force-like elements, one per body, in O(n) time to 
produce a generalized force-like result f=~J*F. If F_G is actually a set of
spatial forces applied at the body frame origin of each body, and expressed
in the Ground frame, then the result is the equivalent set of generalized
forces f that would produce the same accelerations as F_G.

@param[in]      state
    A State compatible with this System that has already been realized to
    Stage::Position.
@param[in]      F_G
    This is a vector of SpatialVec elements, one per mobilized body and in
    order of MobilizedBodyIndex (with the 0th entry a force on Ground; hence
    ignored). Each SpatialVec is a spatial force-like pair of 3-vectors 
    (torque,force) with the force applied at the body origin and the vectors
    expressed in Ground.
@param[out]     f
    This is the product f=~J*F_G as described above. This result is in the
    generalized force space, that is, it has one scalar entry for each of the
    n system mobilities (velocity degrees of freedom). Resized if necessary.

The kinematic Jacobian (partial velocity matrix) J is defined as follows:
<pre>
      partial(V)                                 T                        T
  J = ----------, V = [V_GB0 V_GB1 ... V_GB nb-1] ,  u = [u0 u1 ... u n-1]
      partial(u)
</pre>
Thus the element J(i,j)=partial(V_GBi)/partial(uj) (each element of J is a
spatial vector). J maps generalized speeds to spatial velocities (see
multiplyBySystemJacobian()); its transpose ~J maps spatial forces 
to generalized forces.

Note that we're using "monogram" notation for the spatial velocities, where
<pre>
            G Bi
    V_GBi =  V
</pre>
the spatial velocity of body i's body frame Bi (at its origin), measured and
expressed in the Ground frame G.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
This is a very fast operator, costing about 18*nb+11*n flops, where nb is the
number of bodies and n the number of mobilities (degrees of freedom) u. In 
contrast, even if you have already calculated the entire 6*nbXnu matrix J, the
multiplication ~J*F would cost 12*nb*n flops. As an example, for a 20 body 
system with a free flying base and 19 pin joints (25 dofs altogether), this 
method takes 18*20+11*25=635 flops while the explicit matrix-vector multiply 
would take 12*20*25=6000 flops. So this method is already >9X faster for 
that small system; for larger systems the difference grows rapidly.

@note The 0th row of the returned Jacobian is always zero since it represents
the spatial velocity of Ground.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
Before using this method, consider whether you really need to form this
very large matrix which necessarily will take O(n^2) space and time; it will 
almost always be \e much faster to use the multiplyBySystemJacobian() method 
that directly calculate the matrix-vector product in O(n) time without explictly 
forming the matrix. Here are the details:

As currently implemented, forming the full Jacobian J costs about
12*n*(nb+n) flops. Assuming nb ~= n, this is about 24*n^2 flops. Then
if you want to form a product J*u explicitly, the matrix-vector multiply will 
cost about 12*n^2 flops each time you do it. In contrast the J*u product is 
calculated using multiplyBySystemJacobian() in about 24*n flops. Even for
very small systems it is cheaper to make repeated calls to 
multiplyBySystemJacobian() than to form J explicitly and multiply by it.
See the Performance section for multiplyBySystemJacobian() for more
comparisons.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
It is almost always better to use this method than to form an explicit 3*nt X n 
station task Jacobian explicitly and then multiply by it. If you have only one 
or two tasks, so that the matrix is only 3xn or 6xn, and then perform many 
multiplies with that matrix, it might be slightly cheaper to form it. For 
example, it is about 4X cheaper to use this method than to form a one-task 
Station Jacobian JS explicitly and use it once. However, because this would be 
such a skinny matrix (3 X n) explicit multiplication is cheap so if you will 
re-use this same Jacobian repeatedly before recalculating (at least 6 times) 
then it may be worth calculating and saving it. Here are the details:

A call to this method costs 27*nt + 12*(nb+n) flops. If you assume that 
nb ~= n >> 1, you could say this is about 27*nt + 24*n flops. In
contrast, assuming you already have the 3*nt X n station Jacobian JS available,
you can compute the JS*u product in about 6*nt*n flops, 3X faster for one task,
about even for three tasks, and slower for more than three tasks.
However forming JS costs about 40*nt+90*n flops (see calcStationJacobian()).
So to form a one-task Jacobian and use it once is 4X more expensive (96*n vs
24*n), but if you use it more than 5 times it is cheaper to do it
explicitly. Forming a one-task JS and using it 100 times costs about 690*n 
flops while calling this method 100 times would cost about 2400*n flops.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
A call to this method costs 27*nt + 12*(nb+n) flops. If you assume that 
nb ~= n >> 1, you could say this is about 25*(nt+n) flops. In contrast, assuming 
you already have the 6*nt X n Frame Jacobian JF available, you can compute the
JF*u product in about 12*nt*n flops. If you have just one task (nt==1) this
explicit multiplication is about twice as fast; at two tasks it is about even
and for more than two it is more expensive. However forming JF costs about 
180*(n+nt/4) flops (see calcFrameJacobian()). So to form a one-task Jacobian 
and use it once is almost 8X more expensive (192*n vs 25*n), but if you use it 
more than 16 times it is (marginally) cheaper to do it explicitly (for one
task). For example, forming a one-task JF and using it 100 times costs 1392*n 
flops while calling this method 100 times would cost about 2500*n flops.

Conclusion: in almost all practical cases you are better off using this operator
rather than forming JF, even if you have only a single frame task and certainly 
if you have more than two tasks.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
A call to this method costs 33*nt + 18*nb + 11*n flops. If you assume that 
nb ~= n >> 1, you could say this is about 30*(n+nt) flops. In contrast, assuming 
you already have the 6*nt X n Frame Jacobian JF available, you can compute the
~JF*F product in about 12*nt*n flops. For one or two tasks that would be faster
than applying the operator. However forming JF costs about 180*(n+nt/4) flops 
(see calcFrameJacobian()). So to form even a one-task Frame Jacobian and use 
it once is about 6X more expensive than using the operator (192*n vs 30*n), 
but if you use it more than 10 times it is (marginally) cheaper to do it 
explicitly. For example, forming a one-task JF and using it 100 times costs 
around 1392*n flops while calling this method 100 times would cost about 
3000*n flops.

Conclusion: in almost all practical cases you are better off using this operator
rather than forming JF, even if you have only a single frame task and certainly 
if you have more than two tasks.

/** @name               System matrix manipulation
The documentation for the SimbodyMatterSubsystem describes the system equations
in matrix notion, although internal computations are generally matrix-free.
The operators in this section provide the ability to perform fast operations
that can be described in terms of those matrices (e.g., multiply by the mass
matrix) but are actually done using O(n), matrix-free algorithms. There are
also routines here for obtaining the matrices explicitly, although working with
explicit matrices should be avoided whenever performance is an issue.

The mass matrix M and constraint matrix G are the most significant. G=[P;V;A]
is composed of submatrices P for position (holonomic), V for velocity 
(nonholonomic), and A for acceleration-only constraints. These matrices are
sometimes needed separately. Also, these matrices are all in mobility space
(generalized speeds u). When qdot != u, the matrix N in the equation
qdot = N*u becomes important and operators for working with it efficiently
are also provided here. In that case, the position constraint matrix 
in generalized coordinate q space, Pq, can also be accessed. (In terms of
the other matrices, Pq=P*N^-1.) **/
/**@{**/

/** This operator calculates in O(n) time the product M*v where M is the 
system mass matrix and v is a supplied mobility-space vector (that is, it has
one entry for each of the n mobilities). If v is a set of mobility accelerations

(f=M*udot). Only the supplied vector is used, and M depends only on position 
states, so the result here is not affected by velocities in the State.
Constraints and prescribed motions are ignored.

The current implementation requires about 120*n flops and does not require 
realization of composite-body or articulated-body inertias.

/** This operator calculates in O(n) time the product M^-1*v where M is the

mobility. If v is a set of generalized forces f, the result is a generalized 
acceleration (udot=M^-1*f). Only the supplied vector is used, and M depends 
only on position states, so the result here is not affected by velocities in 
\a state. In particular, you'll have to obtain your own inertial forces and 
put them in f if you want them included.

@param[in]      state
    This is a State that has been realized through Position stage, from which
    the current system configuration and articulated body inertias are 
    obtained. If necessary, the articulated body inertias will be realized in
    the state the first time this is called. They will then be retained in the
    \a state cache for speed.
@param[in]      v
    This is a generalized-force like vector in mobility space (u-space). If 
    there is any prescribed motion specified using Motion objects or mobilizer
    locking (see below), then only the entries of v corresponding to 
    non-prescribed mobilities are examined by this method; the prescribed ones 
    are not referenced at all. 
@param[out]     MinvV
    This is the result M^-1*v. If there is any prescribed motion specified
    using Motion objects or mobilizer locks (see below), then only the 
    non-prescribed entries in MinvV are calculated; the prescribed ones are set 
    to zero.

<h3>Behavior with prescribed motion</h3>
If you prescribe the motion of one or more mobilizers using Motion objects or
mobilizer locking, the behavior of this method is altered. (This does \e not 
apply if you use Constraint objects to specify the motion.) With prescribed
motion enabled, this method works only with the free (non-prescribed) 
mobilities. Only the entries in \a v corresponding to free mobilities are 
examined, and only the entries in the result \a MinvV corresponding to free 
mobilities are calculated; the others are set to zero.

<h3>Theory</h3>
View the unconstrained, prescribed zero-velocity equations of motion 
M udot + tau = f as partitioned into "free" and "prescribed" variables like 
this:
<pre>
    [M_ff ~M_fp] [udot_f]   [ 0 ]   [f_f]
    [          ] [      ] + [   ] = [   ]
    [M_fp  M_pp] [udot_p]   [tau]   [f_p]
</pre>
The free and prescribed variables have been grouped here for clarity but
in general they are interspersed among the columns and rows of M.

Given that decomposition, this method returns
<pre>
    [udot_f]   [udot_f]   [M_ff^-1  0  ][f_f]
    [      ] = [      ] = [            ][   ]
    [udot_p]   [  0   ]   [   0     0  ][f_p]
</pre>
When there is no prescribed motion M_ff is the entire mass matrix, and the 
result is udot_f=udot=M^-1*f. When there is prescribed motion, M_ff is a 
submatrix of M, and the result is the nf elements of udot_f, with udot_p=0.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This is a stripped-down version of forward dynamics. It requires the hybrid
free/prescribed articulated body inertias to have been realized and will 
initiate that calculation if necessary the first time it is called for a given 
configuration q. The M^-1*f calculation requires two sweeps of the multibody 
tree, an inward sweep to accumulate forces, followed by an outward sweep to 
propagate accelerations.

<h3>Performance</h3>
If the supplied State does not already contain realized values for the
articulated body inertias, then they will be realized when this operator is 
first called for a new set of positions. Calculating articulated body inertias
is O(n) but relatively expensive. Once the appropriate articulated body 
inertias are available, repeated calls to this operator are very fast, with 
worst case around 80*n flops when all mobilizers have 1 dof. If you want to
force realization of the articulated body inertias, call the method
realizeArticulatedBodyInertias().

M_ff^-1, that is, it is restricted to the free (non-prescribed) mobilities, but 
scattered into a full n X n matrix (conceptually). See multiplyByMInv() and 
calcMInv() for more information.

W is the projection of the inverse mass matrix into the constraint coordinate
space (that is, the vector space of the multipliers lambda). It can be used to 
solve for the constraint forces that will eliminate a given constraint 
acceleration error:
<pre>
    (1)     W * lambda = aerr
    (2)     aerr = G*udot - b(t,q,u)
</pre>
where udot is an unconstrained generalized acceleration. Note that you can
view equation (1) as a dynamic system in a reduced set of m generalized
coordinates, with the caveat that W may be singular.

In general W is singular and does not uniquely determine lambda. Simbody 
normally calculates a least squares solution for lambda so that loads are 
distributed among redundant constraints. 

@note If you just need to multiply W by a vector or matrix, you do not need
to form W explicitly. Instead you can use the method described in the 
Implementation section to produce a W*v product in the O(n) time it takes to 
compute a single column of W.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
We are able to form W without forming G or M^-1 and without performing any 
matrix-matrix multiplies. Instead, W is calculated using m applications of 
O(n) operators:
    - multiplyByGTranspose() by a unit vector to form a column of ~G
    - multiplyByMInv() to form a column of M^-1 ~G
    - multiplyByG() to form a column of W
    
Even if G and M^-1 were already available, computing W by matrix multiplication
would cost O(m^2*n + m*n^2) time and O(m*n) intermediate storage. Here we do 
it in O(m*n) time with O(n) intermediate storage, which is a \e lot better.

section below for an explanation of the bias term.

@pre \a state realized to Position stage

<h3>Theory</h3>
Simbody's position (holonomic) constraints are defined by the constraint 
error equation 
<pre>
    (1)    perr(t;q) = p(t,q)
</pre>
where we try to maintain perr=0 at all times. We also have available time 
derivatives of equation (1); the first time derivative is relevant here:
<pre>
    (2)    pverr(t,q;qdot) = dperr/dt = Pq * qdot + Pt
</pre>
where Pq=Dperr/Dq and Pt=Dperr/Dt (capital "D" means partial derivative).
Pt=Pt(t,q) is called the "bias" term. (Note that because u=N^-1*qdot we also
have Pq=P*N^-1, where P=Dpverr/Du is the very useful mobility-space holonomic 
constraint Jacobian.) Eq. (2) can be used to perform efficient multiplication 
by Pq, since it can be used to calculate Pq*qlike+Pt, and a second evaluation 
at qlike=0 can be used to calculate the unwanted bias term for removal: 
<pre>
    (3)    Pq*qlike = pverr(t,q;qlike) - pverr(t,q;0)  
</pre>
Despite appearances, eq. (2) calculates its result in constant time per
constraint equation, for a total cost that is O(n) or more strictly O(mp+nq).
The matrix Pq is never actually formed; instead the matrix-vector product
is calculated directly.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
We treat the input vector \a qlike as though it were a set of generalized 
coordinate derivatives qdot. These are mapped to body velocities V in O(n) 
time, using V=Jq*qdot, where Jq is the coordinate space system Jacobian 
(partial velocity matrix), with Jq=J*N^-1. Then the body velocities and qdots 
are supplied to each of the mp active position constraints' (constant time) 
velocity error methods to get pverr(t,q;qlike)=Pq*qlike-Pt in O(n) time. A 
second call is made to evaluate the bias term pverr(t,q;0)=-Pt. We then 
calculate the result \a PqXqlike = pverr(t,q;qlike)-pverr(t,q;0) in O(n) time
using equation (3).

/** This is the primary forward dynamics operator. It takes a state which
has been realized to the Dynamics stage, a complete set of forces to apply,
and returns the accelerations that result. Only the forces supplied here,
and those calculated internally from prescribed motion, constraints, and
centrifugal effects, affect the results. Acceleration constraints are 
always satisfied on return as long as the constraints are consistent. 
If the position and velocity constraints aren't already satisified in the 
State, results are harder to interpret physically, but they will still be 
calculated and the acceleration constraints will still be satisfied. No 
attempt will be made to satisfy position and velocity constraints, or to 
set prescribed positions and velocities, nor even to check whether these 
are satisfied; position and velocity constraint and prescribed positions 
and velocities are simply irrelevant here.

</pre>
where udot={udot_f,udot_p}, tau={0,tau_p}. The unknowns are: the free 
generalized accelerations udot_f, the constraint multipliers lambda, and the 
prescribed motion generalized forces tau_p. A subset udot_p of udot may have 
been prescribed as a known function of state via Motion objects or locks 
associated with the mobilized bodies. On return all the entries in udot will 
have been set to their calculated or prescribed values, and body spatial 
accelerations A_GB (that is, measured and expressed in Ground) are also 
returned. Lambda and tau_p are necessarily calculated but are not returned here.

f_applied is the set of generalized (mobility) forces equivalent to the 
\a appliedMobilityForces and \a appliedBodyForces arguments supplied here. 
That is,
<pre>
    f_applied = appliedMobilityForces + ~J * appliedBodyForces
</pre> 
where J is the system Jacobian mapping between spatial and generalized
coordinates. Typically these forces will have been calculated as a function of 
state so we will have f_applied(t,q,u,z).

M(t,q), G(t,q,u), and b(t,q,u) are defined by the mobilized bodies and 
constraints present in the system. f_inertial(q,u) includes the 
velocity-dependent gyroscopic and coriolis forces due to rigid body 
rotations and is extracted internally from the already-realized state. 

Note that this method does not allow you to specify your own prescribed udots; 
those are calculated from the mobilizers' state-dependent Motion specifications
(or are zero due to mobilizer locks) that are already part of the system.

    A Vector of spatial force vectors, indexed by MobilizedBodyIndex

    force is returned as though it were applied at the origin of the 
    body's mobilizer frame M. The returned force is expressed in the
    Ground frame. Applied mobility (generalized) forces are \e included in the
    returned reaction forces.

A simple way to think of the reaction force is to think of cutting the 
mobilizer, then imagine the force required to make the system move in 
the same manner as when the mobilizer was present. This is what the 
reaction forces accomplish. With that definition, mobility forces (that is,
generalized forces as opposed to body forces) are \e included in the reactions.
Some conventions do not include the mobility forces in the definition of a 
reaction force. We chose to include them since this preserves Newton's 
3rd law of equal and opposite reactions between bodies. Ours is the same 
convention as used in SD/FAST.

@note You can think of the Ground body being welded to the universe at the
Ground origin. The reactions reported for Ground are the ones that would 
occur in that Weld mobilizer if it were really present. That is, it includes
the effects of all the base bodies on Ground.

<h3>How to find the reaction felt by the parent body</h3>

A mobilizer connects a frame F fixed on the parent (inboard) body P to a
frame M fixed on the child (outboard) body B. It exerts equal and opposite 
reaction forces on the two bodies, at a given location in space. This method 
reports the force on the child body, as though it were applied at the origin 
Mo of frame M, and expressed in the Ground frame. The force on the parent body
<em>at Mo</em> is just the negative of the returned value. However, it is 
more likely that you would want it as felt <em>at Fo</em>, the origin of the
F frame on the parent. Here is one way to calculate that from the returned
quantities:
@code
    matter.calcMobilizerReactionForces(state,forcesAtMInG); // This method.
    const int nb = matter.getNumBodies();
    Vector_<SpatialVec> forcesAtFInG(nb); // to hold the result
    forcesAtFInG[0] = -forcesAtMInG[0]; // Ground is "welded" at origin
    for (MobilizedBodyIndex i(1); i < nb; ++i) {
        const MobilizedBody& body   = matter.getMobilizedBody(i);
        const MobilizedBody& parent = body.getParentMobilizedBody();
        // Want to shift reaction by p_MF, the vector from M to F across the
        // mobilizer, and negate. Can get p_FM; must reexpress in G.
        const Vec3& p_FM = body.getMobilizerTransform(state).p();
        const Rotation& R_PF = body.getInboardFrame(state).R(); // In parent.
        const Rotation& R_GP = parent.getBodyTransform(state).R();
        Rotation R_GF   =   R_GP*R_PF;  // F frame orientation in Ground.
        Vec3     p_MF_G = -(R_GF*p_FM); // Re-express and negate shift vector. 
        forcesAtFInG[i] = -shiftForceBy(forcesAtMInG[i], p_MF_G);
    }
@endcode

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This method combines already-calculated quantities to calculate the reactions.
See Abhi Jain's 2011 book "Robot and Multibody Dynamics", Eq. 7.34 page 128: 
<pre>   F_reaction = PPlus*APlus + zPlus  </pre>
where P is the articulated body inertia, A is the spatial acceleration,
a the Coriolis acceleration and z the articulated body forces, and "Plus"
indicates that we evaluate these on the inboard (parent) side of the mobilizer
rather than on the body's side. (The alternative P(A-a)+z given there does not 
work for prescribed mobilizers unless you replace "a" with "a_underscore" from
equation 16.14.) After calculating F_reaction at the body frame
origin Bo, we shift it to M for reporting.

<h3>Performance</h3>
The cost of the above calculation is 114 flops/body. The code presented
above for converting from M to F costs an additional 81 flops/body if you
use it.

/** @name              Testing and debugging utilities

Methods in this section provide alternate ways of calculating quantities for
which we provide more efficient methods above. You should use the better 
methods normally, but these can be very useful for regression testing and
Simbody development because the answers are obtained differently. Numerical
results should agree with the faster methods to within numerical precision. **/
/**@{**/

/** This is a slower alternative to calcMobilizerReactionForces(), for use in
regression testing and Simbody development. This method builds a freebody
"diagram" for each body in turn to determine the unknown reaction force at
its inboard mobilizer.

The given \a state must have been realized through Acceleration stage.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
We use a tip-to-base recursion in which we assemble all applied body forces
from force elements, constraints, and gyroscopic effects and compare that with
the apparent rigid body force determined from F=M*A where M is a body's 
spatial inertia (in G) and A its already-calculated spatial acceleration. The 
difference is the missing force applied by the body's mobilizer, i.e. the 
reaction force. That is shifted to the M frame and reported. Then the equal
and opposite reaction is applied to the parent body and included in its 
collection of applied forces, which can be used to determine its reaction force
and so on.

This is is about 3X slower than the method used by 
calcMobilizerReactionForces().
