/** This force element represents a uniform gravitational field applied to a
set of bodies. This can be used instead of the more limited
Force::UniformGravity class if you want more control.

Force::Gravity is given a magnitude g in units of acceleration, and a "down"
direction (unit vector) d, expressed in the Ground frame. For example, in SI
units "standard gravity" g at the Earth's surface is defined to be exactly
g=9.80665 m/s^2. If gravity acts in Ground's -Y direction, then its direction
vector is d=[0,-1,0]; together this yields a gravity vector
v=g*d=[0,-9.80665,0]. By default gravity will be applied to each MobilizedBody
in the given SimbodyMatterSubsystem (except for Ground). You can specify that
some bodies are excluded; those will not have a gravity force applied. You can
include multiple Force::Gravity elements with different exclusion lists in the
same System if you want different bodies to feel different effects.

\par Force
Each body B that has not been explicitly excluded will experience a force
fb = mb*g*d, applied to its center of mass, where mb is the mass of body B.
Although this is a pure force, note that when it is measured in the body frame
B there will also be a moment unless the body frame origin Bo is located at the
body's mass center. You can obtain the applied forces if you need them, for
example for gravity compensation; see getBodyForces().

\par Potential Energy
Gravitational potential energy for a body B is mb*g*hb where hb is the height of
body B's mass center over an arbitrary "zero" height hz (default is hz=0),
measured along the "up" direction -d. If pb is the Ground frame vector giving
the position of body B's mass center, its height over or under hz is
hb=pb*(-d) - hz. Note that this is a signed quantity so the potential energy is
also signed.

  - Changing one of these default parameters invalidates the containing
