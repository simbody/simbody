/**
 * This is a feedback-controlled force that uses Nose'-Hoover chains to
 * maintain a particular temperature Tb, as though the system were immersed in
 * an infinite heat bath at that temperature. There are two parameters, the
 * temperature Tb and a "relaxation time" t which controls how tightly the
 * temperature is maintained. This thermostat is particularly useful in
 * molecular simulations but can be applied to any mechanical system also.
 *
 * Temperature is defined here as T = (2*KE) / (N*kB) where KE is the system
 * kinetic energy, N is the number of coupled degrees of freedom (mobilities
 * minus active, nonredundant constraints, minus up to 6 rigid body dofs for
 * the system as a whole), and kB is Boltzmann's constant in appropriate units.
 *
 * We use a Nose'-Hoover chain to achieve excellent statistical mechanics
 * properties with a continuous force. At equilibrium the temperature will have
 * a Boltzmann distribution; the relaxation time controls how long it takes the
 * system to reach equilibrium with the bath. Smaller values of relaxation time
 * produce faster response but can make the system stiff and will normally
 * require smaller step sizes; larger values will take longer to equilibrate
 * but will run faster.
 *
 * This Force does not produce any potential energy. However, there is a "bath
 * energy" available through a separate call which can be used in combination
 * with the system energy to construct a conserved quantity; this is described
 * further below.
 *
 * \par Theory:
 *
 * The current system temperature is defined
 * <pre>
 *      T = (2*KE) / (N*kB)
 * </pre>
 * where KE is the kinetic energy of the moving bodies whose N degrees of
 * freedom are being controlled (not necessarily all the bodies in the system),
 * and kB is Boltzmann's constant. Our goal here is to control T so that it
 * follows a Boltzmann distribution around the specified bath temperature Tb.
 *
 * For an m-chain Nose'-Hoover chain, we will define m auxiliary "thermostat"
 * state variables c[i], 0<=i<m, with units of 1/time. The 0'th thermostat
 * variable c[0] is used to generate a generalized force f applied to the
 * system mobilities u:
 * <pre>
 *      f = -c[0] * M * u
 * </pre>
 * where M is the system mass matrix and u is the vector of generalized speeds.
 * (Note that in Simbody the M*u product is formed in O(n) time; M itself
 * is never formed.) The c variables should be initialized to zero at the
 * start of a simulation. Ideally, you should initialize the u's so that they
 * are already at the right temperature, but if not you should still make them
 * non-zero -- you can see above that if you have no velocities you will get
 * no Nose'-Hoover forces.
 *
 * If m==1, we have the standard Nose'-Hoover method except with a relaxation
 * time specified instead of the thermal mass parameter, as in reference [2]:
 * <pre>
 *      cdot[0]   =   (T/Tb - 1)/t^2
 * </pre>
 * Otherwise, for m > 1 we have:
 * <pre>
 *      cdot[0]   =   (T/Tb - 1)/t^2 - c[0]*c[1]
 *      cdot[1]   = N*c[0]^2 - 1/t^2 - c[1]*c[2]
 *      cdot[i]   = c[i-1]^2 - 1/t^2 - c[i]*c[i+1]   (2<=i<m-1)
 *      cdot[m-1] = c[m-2]^2 - 1/t^2
 * </pre>
 * For comparison with the literature where thermal mass parameters Qi are
 * used, we use Q0 = N kB Tb t^2 and Qi = kB Tb t^2, i > 0. That is, the first
 * thermostat that controls the N thermal degrees of freedom is N times
 * "heavier" than the subsequent ones, each of which controls only the one
 * dof of its next-lower thermostat. See refs [1] and [2].
 *
 * In addition there is a set of state variables si given by sdot[i]=c[i].
 * Together these permit us to define a "bath energy" which can be combined
 * with system energy to produce a conserved quantity. Bath energy is KEb+PEb
 * where
 * <pre>
 *      KEb = 1/2 kB Tb t^2 (N c[0]^2 + sum(c[i]^2))
 *      PEb = kB Tb (N s[0] + sum(s[i]))
 * </pre>
 * where kB is Boltzmann's constant, Tb the bath temperature, N the number of
 * thermal degrees of freedom in the temperature definition, and the sums run
 * from 1 to m-1. Note that you must request the bath energy separately; we do
 * not return any potential energy for this force otherwise.
