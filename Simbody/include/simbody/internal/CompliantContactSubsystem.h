transfer energy back to the bodies and will instead vibrate or ring until

//                               CONTACT FORCE
//==============================================================================
/** This is a simple class containing the basic force information for a
single contact between deformable surfaces S1 and S2 mounted on rigid
bodies B1 and B2. Every contact interaction between two rigid bodies, however
complex, can be expressed as a resultant that can be contained in this class
and is sufficient for advancing a simulation. Optionally, you may be able to
get more details about the deformed geometry and pressure distribution over the
patch but you have to ask for that separately because it can be expensive to
calculate or report.

The information stored here is:
  - A point in space at which equal and opposite forces will be applied to
    corresponding stations of the two interacting rigid bodies. This is called
    the "contact point".
  - The force vector to be applied there (to each body with opposite sign).
  - A moment vector to be applied to both bodies (with opposite signs).
  - The potential energy currently stored by the elasticity of the contacting
    materials.
  - The instantaneous power dissipation due to inelastic behavior such as
    friction and internal material damping.

Points and vectors are measured and expressed in some assumed but unspecified
frame A, which might for example be the frame of one of the two surfaces, or
one of the two bodies, or Ground. Whenever a method returns a ContactForce
object it must document what frame is being used; typically that will be
Ground for end user use.

<h3>Definition of center of pressure</h3>

When the contact patch itself involves many distributed contact points, the
center of pressure might not be a particularly meaningful quantity but
serves to provide enough information to proceed with a simulation, and to
display resultant contact forces, without requiring detailed patch geometry
information. We define the location r_c of the center of pressure like this:
@verbatim
           sum_i (r_i * |r_i X Fn_i|)
     r_c = --------------------------
              sum_i |r_i X Fn_i|
@endverbatim
where r_i is the vector locating contact point i, F_i=Fn_i+Ft_i is the
contact force at point i resolved into locally-normal and locally-tangential
components, and M_i is a pure moment if any generated by the contact force
model as a result of the i'th contact point. Note that the locally-
tangent contact force Ft_i (presumably from friction) and pure moment M_i
do not contribute to the center of pressure calculation; we're choosing
the point that minimizes the net moment generated by normal ("pressure")
forces only. Note that the normal force Fn_i includes both stiffness and
dissipation contributions, so the center of pressure can be
velocity-dependent. **/

//                              CONTACT DETAIL
//==============================================================================
/** This provides deformed geometry and force details for one element of a
contact patch that may be composed of many elements. Every element generates
equal and opposite forces on both surfaces so we can use a consistent
patch-centered convention for reporting details regardless of the original
source of the element.

<h3>Deformed patch geometry</h3>

Vector results are expressed in Ground. We return
  - the contact point C where equal and opposite forces are applied to
    <em>material points</em> of the two surfaces.
  - the contact normal direction n pointing \e away from surface1's exterior
    and towards surface2's interior
  - the slip velocity v of surface 2 relative to surface 1, measured at C
    and in the plane perpendicular to n
  - the force applied to body 2 by body 1; that is, its normal component
    is in direction n and its tangential component opposes velocity v

It is important to note that we are interested in the motion (deformations) of
<em>material points</em> here, \e not the motion of the <em>contact point</em>
which is a non-material concept and thus not directly involved in producing
forces. The patch area is provided separately and its significance also depends
on the model.

<h3>Elasticity and dissipation</h3>

We report the combined deformation (>= 0) of the two surfaces at C, along the
normal n. We do not attempt to report angular deformation of the element. Elastic
deformation rate is also provided. This is the rate that the material points
currently at C are compressing or relaxing along the normal. That is, we are not
including the fact that the contact point C may be moving along
the surfaces, we just report what is happening to the material in its own
frame. Note that we do not attempt to report angular deformation rate.

<h3>Slipping and friction</h3>

Slip velocity measures the relative velocity of the body stations that are
instantaneously coincident with C. This will be in the plane for which n is the
normal, but it is expressed in Ground so is a 3d vector.

<h3>%Force and pressure</h3>

%Contact force is the force being
applied to surface 2 by surface 1 at the contact point C. This includes
the normal force due to elasticity and dissipation, and
the tangential force due to friction and to tangential elasticity and
dissipation, if any.

Peak pressure is a scalar providing the worst-case pressure present somewhere
in the patch, if the model can provide that. Otherwise it will be the
normal force divided by the patch area to give the average pressure across
the patch.

<h3>Energy and power</h3>

Potential energy is the amount of energy currently stored in the elastic
deformation of this element. Summing this over all the contact detail
elements should yield the same value as is reported as the resultant potential
energy for this contact.

Power loss is the rate at which energy is being lost due to dissipation and
to friction, but not due to elastic deformation because that is contributing
to potential energy and we expect to get it back. Summing this over all the
contact detail elements should yield the same value as is reported as the
resultant power loss for this contact. **/

//==============================================================================
/** A ContactPatch is the description of the forces and the deformed shape of
the contact surfaces that result from compliant contact interactions. This
should not be confused with the Contact object that describes only the
overlap in \e undeformed surface geometry and knows nothing of forces or
materials. Although there are several qualitatively different kinds of
compliant contact models, we assume that each can be described by some number
of contact "elements" and report the detailed results in terms
of those elements. Depending on the model, the elements may be associated with
the surfaces or may be associated with the patch. Either way, every element
applies equal and opposite forces to both surfaces. There is not necessarily
any direct correspondence between elements on one surface with elements on the
other.

A Hertz contact will have only a single element that belongs to the patch,
while an elastic foundation contact will have many, with each element
associated with one or the other surface. Only the elements that are currently
participating in contact will have entries here; the surface and element id is
stored with each piece of ContactDetail information. There is also some basic
information needed to advance the simulation and that is common to all contact
patch types and stored as a ContactForce resultant. **/
