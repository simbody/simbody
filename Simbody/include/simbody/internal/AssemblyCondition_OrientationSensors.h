//                           ORIENTATION SENSORS
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/** This AssemblyCondition specifies a correspondence between orientation
sensors fixed on mobilized bodies ("osensors") and Ground-relative orientation
sensor readings ("observations"). Each osensor represents the three orthogonal
axis directions of a frame fixed to a mobilized body; only orientation and not
location is represented. Orientation sensing is commonly performed by
Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs). The behavior here is designed to be as
similar as possible to position sensors handled by the Markers
AssemblyCondition. You can combine OrientationSensors and Markers on the same
body.

The idea is to adjust the q's so that each osensor is oriented similarly to its
corresponding observation. This is normally used as a goal since we don't expect
to be able to obtain a perfect match, but you can use these as a set of
assembly error conditions if there are enough degrees of freedom to achieve a
near-perfect solution.

Osensors are defined one at a time and assigned sequential index values
of type OrientationSensors::OSensorIx. They may optionally be given unique,
case-sensitive names, and we will keep a map from name to OSensorIx. A default
name will be assigned if none is given. A weight is assigned to every osensor,
with default weight=1. We do not expect that all the osensors will be used;
osensors with weights of zero will not be included in the study, nor will
osensors for which no observation is given.

Once specified, the osensor definitions do not change during a series of inverse
kinematic (tracking) steps. The observations, on the other hand, are expected
to come from a time series of experimental measurements of osensor orientations
and will be different at every step. They typically come from a file organized
by "frame", meaning an observation time and a set of observed orientations, one
per sensor, corresponding to that time. During initial setup, the number of
observations per frame and their correspondence to the defined osensors is
specified. They can be in any order, may skip some osensors, and may include
data for osensors that are not defined. However, once initialized each frame
must supply the same information in the same order. Data for an unobserved
osensor can be provided as NaN in which case it will be ignored in that frame.
The frame time is supplied to the track() method which initiates assembly for
a frame.

Observation-osensor correspondence maps an ObservationIx to a unique OSensorIx.
By default, we'll expect to get an observation for each osensor and that the
observation order and the osensor order are the same, i.e.
ObservationIx==OSensorIx for every osensor. However, you can instead define
observation/osensor correspondence yourself, (\e after all osensors have been
defined), via one of the defineObservationOrder() methods. This is done by
supplying an array of OSensorIx values, or an array of osensor names, with the
array elements ordered by ObservationIx. Any invalid osensor index or
unrecognized osensor name means we will ignore values provide for that
observation; similarly, any osensors whose index or name is not specified at
all will be ignored.
