/** A discrete mobility (generalized) force f applied to a particular mobility
that is specified at construction.\ Useful for applying
external forces or forces that are updated at discrete times due to the
occurrence of events. Note that a mobility is a generalized speed (u), not
a generalized coordinate (q). The meaning of a generalized force depends on the
definition of the generalized speed. If that speed is a translation then this is
a force; if a rotation then this is a torque; if something else then f has a
comparable definition (the defining condition is that f*u should always have
physically meaningful units of power). This force does not contribute to the
potential energy, so adding it to a system will cause potential+kinetic energy
not to be conserved.

If you want to be able to apply discrete forces to any body or mobilizer
without specifying which one in advance, see Force::DiscreteForces.

    @param mobod         mobilizer to which the force should be applied
    @param whichU        to which of the mobilizer's mobilities (degrees of

    Note that if you have an integer value for the generalized speed (u) index,
    you have to cast it to a MobilizerUIndex here. The generalized speeds are
    numbered starting with 0 for each mobilizer. Here is an example:
