/** This class represents the path of a frictionless cable from an origin point
fixed to a body, over geometric obstacles fixed to other bodies, to a final
termination point.

The CableSpan's path can be seen as consisting of straight line segments and
curved line segments: A curved segment over each obstacle, and straight segments
connecting them to each other and to the end points. Each curved segment is
computed as a geodesic to give (in some sense) a shortest path over the surface.
During a simulation the cable can slide freely over the obstacle surfaces. It
can lose contact with a surface and miss that obstacle in a straight line.
Similarly the cable can touchdown on the obstacle if the surface obstructs the
straight line segment again.

The path is computed as an optimization problem using the previous optimal path
as the warm start. This is done by computing natural geodesic corrections for
each curve segment to compute the locally shortest path, as described in the
following publication:

    Scholz, A., Sherman, M., Stavness, I. et al (2015). A fast multi-obstacle
    muscle wrapping method using natural geodesic variations. Multibody System
    Dynamics 36, 195â€“219.

The overall path is locally the shortest, allowing winding over an obstacle
multiple times, without flipping to the other side.

During initialization the path is assumed to be in contact with each obstacle at
the user defined contact-point-hint. At each contact point a
zero-length-geodesic is computed with the tangent estimated as pointing from the
previous path point to the next path point. From this configuration, the solver
is started, and the geodesics will be corrected until the entire path is smooth.

Important to note is that the cable's interaction with the obstacles is ordered
based on the order in which they were added. That is, if three obstacles are
added to a cable, then, the cable can wrap over the first, then the second, and
then the third. If the first obstacle spatially collides with the path twice it
will not actually wrap over it twice. Use CablePath if this is not the desired
behavior.

Note that a CableSpan is a geometric object, not a force or constraint element.
That is, a CableSpan alone will not influence the behavior of a simulation.
However, forces and constraint elements can be constructed that make use of a
CableSpan to generate forces.

A CableSpan must be registered with a CableSubsystem which manages their
runtime evaluation. **/

/** Helper class for testing correctness of all currently computed paths in a
CableSubsystem.

For each CableSpan's computed path it is checked that:
1. Any curve segment over an obstacle is a correct geodesic.
2. The path error Jacobian matches a perturbation test.

The geodesics and Jacobians are internal to the CableSpan's implementation, we
refer to the following publication to understand their role:

    Scholz, A., Sherman, M., Stavness, I. et al (2015). A fast multi-obstacle
    muscle wrapping method using natural geodesic variations. Multibody System
    Dynamics 36, 195â€“219.

Consider a bug in the code, then this test is designed to have
high sensitivity (and lower specificity). That is, if you pass, you can rest
assured that all curve segments are indeed geodesics, and that the Jacobian
correctly predicts the local effect of the NaturalGeodesicCorrection on the
path error vector. It is possible to fail this test in the absence of any bugs
by using incompatible configuration parameters; e.g. by setting a very poor
integrator accuracy for the CableSpan, and using a very small perturbation value
in the Jacobian perturbation test. For use in a unit test a high sensitivity
works just fine: If you pass it normally, you should pass it after a code
refactor as well.

Testing each computed path in your simulation is possible, but will criple your
simulation speed.
