    calcForce() method which adds its force contributions if any to the
    appropriate array elements for bodies, particles, and mobilities. Note that
    in general we have no idea what elements of the system are affected by a 
    force element, and in fact that can change based on state and time (consider
    contact forces, for example). A disabled force element will return all 
    zeroes without invoking calcForce(), since that method may depend on
    earlier computations which may not have been performed in that case.
    @param[in]      state
        The State containing information to be used by the force element to
        calculate the current force. This must have already been realized to
        a high enough stage for the force element to get what it needs; if you
        don't know then realize it to Stage::Velocity.
    @param[out]     bodyForces
        This is a Vector of spatial forces, one per mobilized body in the 
        matter subsystem associated with this force element. This Vector is
        indexed by MobilizedBodyIndex so it has a 0th entry corresponding
        to Ground. A spatial force contains two Vec3's; index with [0] to get
        the moment vector, with [1] to get the force vector. This argument is
        resized if necessary to match the number of mobilized bodies and any
        unused entry will be set to zero on return.
    @param[out]     particleForces
        This is a Vector of force vectors, one per particle in the 
        matter subsystem associated with this force element. This vector is
        indexed by ParticleIndex; the 0th entry is the 1st particle, not Ground.
        This argument is resized if necessary to match the number of particles
        and any unused entry will be set to zero on return. (As of March 2010 
        Simbody treats particles as mobilized bodies so this is unused.)
    @param[out]     mobilityForces
        This is a Vector of scalar generalized forces, one per mobility in 
        the matter subsystem associated with this force element. This is the
        same as the number of generalized speeds u that collectively represent
        all the mobilities of the mobilizers. To determine the per-mobilizer
        correspondence, you must call methods of MobilizedBody; there is no
        hint here. 
    @note This method must zero out the passed in arrays, and in most cases
    almost all returned entries will be zero, so this is \e not the most
    efficent way to calculate forces; use it sparingly. For a more efficent way
    to calculate force contributions from multiple force elements, see
