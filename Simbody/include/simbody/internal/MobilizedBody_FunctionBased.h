/** This is a subclass of MobilizedBody::Custom which uses a set of Function
objects to define the behavior of the %MobilizedBody. When you create it, you
specify the number of generalized coordinates, and six Function objects which
calculate the spatial rotations and translations based on those coordinates.
It assumes there is a one to one correspondence between generalized coordinates
and generalized speeds, so qdot == u.

Each of the Function objects must take some subset of the generalized
coordinates as inputs, and produce a single number as its output. It also must
support derivatives up to second order.  Taken together, the six functions
define a SpatialVec giving the body's mobilizer transform. **/
