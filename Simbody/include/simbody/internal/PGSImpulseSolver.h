/** Projected Gauss Seidel impulse solver.
Finds a solution to

    subject to
    piExpand <= 0 (given)

    piUnknown_z <= 0         unilateral contact must push, not pull
    ||(piUnknown_x,piUnknown_y)|| <= -mu*pi_z   unilateral friction cone
    where pi=piExpand+piUnknown.

    piUnknown_speed <= 0           one-way ratchets
    lb <= piUnknown_bounded <= ub  torque-limited motor

    ||piUnknown_F|| <= mu*||piUnknown_N||  friction in bilateral constraint
    ||piUnknown_F|| <= mu*N                friction with known normal force N
</pre>
When piUnknown_z[k] hits its upper limit of 0, we must have v_z[k] >= 0
(contact surfaces separating). We don't explicitly enforce that here; it
depends on all diag(A)[z[k]] > 0. That means that if v_z[k]<0 we could improve
the solution by making piUnknown_z[k] negative, so it wouldn't have hit the
limit.
