//=============================================================================
/** Class ExponentialSpringForce uses an "exponential spring" as a means
of modeling contact of a specified point on a MobilizedBody with a contact
plane that is fixed to Ground. In this documentation, this specified point
is referred to as the "body station". Each ExponentialSpringForce instance
acts at only one body station. In practice, you should choose a number of
body stations strategically located across the surface of a MobilizedBody,
and construct an ExponentialSpringForce for each of those body stations. For
example, if the body were a cube, you would likely choose the body stations
to be the corners of the cube and construct an ExponentialSpringForce
instance for each corner of the cube (so a total of 8 instances). The contact
plane is typically used to model interactions with a floor, but need not be
limited to this use case. The contact plane can be rotated and displaced
relative to the Ground frame and so can be used to model a wall, ramp, or
some other planar structure.

A distinguishing feature of the exponential spring, relative to traditional
contact models, is that it ALWAYS applies a force to the body; there is
never a time in a simulation when the spring force is not applied. This
seemingly non-physical feature works because (assuming default parameters are
in use) the force becomes small (less than 0.01 N) as soon as the body station
is more than 1.0 cm above the contact plane and extremely small (less than
0.000001 N) as soon as the body station is more than 2.0 cm above the contact
plane. The sizes of these forces are likely small compared to the errors made
in neglecting air resistance, assuming a uniform gravitational field, or
estimating inertial parameters.

As a side note, electrostatic forces, which are the fundamental force from
which all conventional contact forces arise, are never actually zero either.
They obey Coulomb's Law (Fₑ = kₑq₁q₂/r²) which states that an
electrostatic force only approaches zero as the distance between two
charges (r) approaches infinity. It is certainly not the case that exponential
springs accurately model contact force at the level of electrostatic forces;
we only suggest that the use of a contact force field that acts over a great
distance is reasonable as long as the force gets sufficiently small
sufficiently quickly.

Introducing any additional modeling approximation into a simulation is hard to
justify, however, unless there are significant benefits. In the case of
exponential springs there are two: simplicity and speed. With exponential
springs, there is no need to search for body intersections (the number of
active springs does not change during a simulation) and there is no need to
find the precise time of contact. In addition, because the function
describing the contact force is smooth, the integration step sizes taken
by variable-step explicit integrators are often well-behaved.

One of the challenges in modeling friction is handling the static
case. When the net force applied to a body in a direction tangent to a contact
plane is less than the limiting value of the static friction force (μₛ Fₙ),
the body should not drift but remain fixed in place. One approach to handling
this case is to apply conditional constraints that enforce zero acceleration
of the body in the contact plane. Unfortunately, implementation of this
approach is complex, particularly if there are multiple contact points on the
body. Another approach is to apply a velocity-dependent frictional force
that opposes any slide velocity (i.e., f = -cv). This latter approach is
relatively simple to implement, but will not entirely eliminate drift. By
making c very large, the drift velocity can be made small but it cannot be
brought to zero. And, unfortunately, as c is made large, the system equations
can become stiff, requiring integrator step size to be reduced, sometimes
considerably (at least in explicit integrators).

Part of the speed-up offered by ExponentialSpringForce derives, not from the
use of an exponential for the normal force, but from the friction model
employed. ExponentialSpringForce uses a spring-based frictional model that
includes a velocity-dependent (damping) term AND a position-dependent
(elastic) term. By including the elastic term, drift is entirely eliminated
and relatively large integration step sizes are maintained.

Computationally, using class ExponentialSpringForce to model contact is
usually faster than using class CompliantContactSubsystem, and yet simulated
motions are typically quite similar. For default parameter choices,
ExponentialSpringForce is about 2x faster. However, if the drift velocity of
CompliantContactSubsystem is brought down to 0.001 m/s, ExponentialSpringForce
can be 100x faster. Computational comparisons can be performed by building and
running the Test_Adhoc - ExponentialSpringsComparison project that is included
with Simbody.

Aspects of the exponential spring contact model are described in the following
publication:

        Anderson F.C. and Pandy M.G. (1999). A dynamics optimization
        solution for vertical jumping in three dimensions. Computer Methods
        in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering 2(3):201-231.

The current class makes several improvements to that contact model, most
notably including 1) the ability to rotate and translate the contact plane and
2) the ability to specify both a static and a kinetic coefficient of friction. 
The computational details of the contact model implemented by this class
follow below.

----------------------------------
Computations and Coordinate Frames
----------------------------------
The positive z-axis of the contact plane defines its normal. The positive
z-axis is the axis along which the repelling normal force (modeled using an
exponential) is applied. The x-axis and y-axis of the contact plane together
define the tangent plane. Friction forces will always be tangent to the x-y
plane.

In the equations below, a variable with a "z" suffix (e.g., pz, vz, or cz)
refers to a quantity that is normal to the contact plane or that pertains
to calculation of the normal force. A variable with an "xy" suffix
(e.g., pxy, vxy, or cxy) refers to a quantity that lies in or is tangent to
the contact plane or that pertains to calculation of the friction force.

### Normal Force (positive z-axis)

The elastic part of the normal force is computed using an exponential
whose shape is a function of three parameters (d₀, d₁, and d₂):

        fzElastic = d₁exp(−d₂(pz−d₀))

Note that pz is the displacement of the body station above (pz > 0.0)
or below (pz < 0.0) the contact plane. The default values of the shape
parameters were chosen to maximize integration step size while maintaining a
number of constraints (e.g., the normal force should fall below 0.01 Newtons
when pz > 1.0 cm). The damping part of the normal force is linear in velocity
and scaled by the elastic part:

        fzDamping = −cz vz fzElastic,

where vz is the normal component of the velocity of the body station and
cz is the damping coefficient for the normal direction. All together, the
spring force in the normal direction is given by

        fz  = fzElastic + fzDamping
            = d₁exp(d₂(py−d₀)) − cz vz d₁exp(d₂(pz−d₀)))
            = d₁exp(d₂(pz−d₀)) (1 − cz vz)

which has the form of the Hunt & Crossley damping model:

        K. H. Hunt and F. R. E. Crossley (1975). Coefficient of Restitution
        Interpreted as Damping in Vibroimpact. ASME Journal of Applied
        Mechanics, pp. 440-445.

### Friction Force (x-y plane)

The friction force is computed by blending two different friction models.
The blending is performed based on the 'Sliding' State of the
ExponentialSpringForce class. 'Sliding' characterizes the extent to which
either static or kinetic conditions are present.

        Sliding = 0.0     static- fully fixed in place (lower bound)
        Sliding = 1.0     kinetic- fully sliding (upper bound)

Details about the Sliding %State are given in sections below.

#### Friction Model 1 - Pure Damping (Sliding = 1.0)
When the body station is sliding with respect to the contact plane, the
friction force is computed using a simple damping term:

        fricDamp = −cxy vxy

where cxy is the damping coefficient in the contact plane and vxy is the
velocity of the body station in the contact plane expressed in the contact
plane. However, the magnitude of the total frictional force is not allowed to
exceed the frictional limit:

        fricLimit = μ fz
        if (|fricDamp| > fricLimit)
            fricDamp = −fricLimit vxy / |vxy| = −μ fz vxy / |vxy|

where μ is the instantaneous coefficient of friction (more below). Note that
fz is always positive and so fricLimit is a positive scalar. Thus, for
velocities in the contact plane above some threshold velocity, which is
typically small (i.e., less than 0.1 m/s), this model is consistent with a
standard Coulomb Friction model.

#### Friction Model 2 - Damped Linear Spring (Sliding = 0.0)
When the body station is anchored with respect to the contact plane, the
friction force is represented by a damped linear spring. The viscous term is
given by the same damping expression as above:

        fricDampSpr = −cxy vxy

and the elastic term is given by

        fricElasSpr = −kxy (pxy−p₀)

where kxy is the friction spring elasticity, pxy is the position of the body
station projected onto the contact plane, and p₀ is the current spring zero
(i.e., the elastic anchor point of the friction spring). Note that p₀ always
resides in the contact plane.

The total friction spring force is then given by the sum of the elastic and
viscous terms:

        fricSpr = fricElasSpr + fricDampSpr

If the magnitude of the fricSpr exceeds the magnitude of the friction limit,
the terms are scaled down:

        if(|fricSpr| > fricLimit)
            scaleFactor = fricLimit / |fricSpr|
            fricDampSpr = scaleFactor * fricDampSpr
            fricElasSpr = scaleFactor * fricElasSpr
            fricSpr = fricElasSpr + fricDampSpr

Note that scaling down the friction spring force does not alter its direction.

#### Blending the Friction Models
Blending Model 1 and Model 2 is accomplished using linear expressions of the
Sliding State:

        fricElasBlend = fricElasSpr * (1.0 − Sliding)
        fricDampBlend = fricDampSpr + (fricDamp − fricDampSpr)*Sliding
        fricBlend = fricElasBlend + fricDampBlend

Model 1 (Pure Damping) dominates as Sliding → 1.0, and Model 2 (Damped Linear
Spring) dominates as Sliding → 0.0. The blending is well behaved and smooth
for all values of Sliding between 0.0 and 1.0.

#### Moving the Elastic Anchor Point
The elastic anchor point (p₀) (i.e., the friction spring zero) is always made
to be consistent with the final value of the blended elastic force
(fricElasBlend):

        p₀ = pxy + fricElasBlend / kxy;
        p₀[2] = 0.0;  // ensures that p₀ lies in the contact plane

When fricElasBlend = 0.0, notice that p₀ = pxy, p₀[2] = 0.0. In other words,
when Sliding = 1.0, p₀ is simply the position of the body station projected
onto the contact plane.

In Simbody, p₀ is handled as an Auto Update Discrete %State. See
State::allocateAutoUpdateDiscreteVariable() for a detailed description. Any
change to p₀ is made to the Update Cache (not to the State directly), and the
integrator moves this cache value to the actual p₀ State after a successful
integration step is obtained.

#### Coefficients of Friction and the Sliding State
Coefficients of kinetic (sliding) and static (fixed) friction can be specified
separately for the spring, subject to the following constraints:

        0.0 ≤ μₖ ≤ μₛ

Note that there is no upper bound on μₛ. The instantaneous coefficient of
friction (μ) is calculated based on the value of the Sliding State:

        μ = μₛ − Sliding*(μₛ − μₖ)

Like the elastic anchor point (p₀), Sliding is handled as an Auto Update
Discrete State. Again, see State::allocateAutoUpdateDiscreteVariable() for a
detailed description. Any change to Sliding is made to the Update Cache
(not to the State directly), and the integrator moves the cache value to the
actual Sliding State after a successful integration step is obtained.

The value of Sliding is calculated using a continuous function of the
ratio of the speed of the elastic anchor point (ṗ₀) to the settle velocity
(vSettle). vSettle is a customizable topology-stage parameter that represents
the speed at which a body station settles into a static state. See
ExponentialSpringParameters::setSettleVelocity() for details. Specifically,
Sliding is calculated as follows:

        ṗ₀ = |Δp₀| / Δt
        Sliding = SimTK::stepUp( SimTK::clamp(0.0, ṗ₀/vSettle, 1.0) )

where Δp₀ is the change in p₀ and Δt is the change in time since the last
successful integration step. When ṗ₀ ≥ vSettle, Sliding = 1.0, and as
ṗ₀ → 0.0, Sliding → 0.0.

### Future Enhancements

Enhancements might include the capacity to
- Fix the contact plane to a body other than Ground,
- Use a polygonal mesh as the contact surface, and
- Move the body station in manner that adapts to contact circumstances. For
example, to model a coin rolling on a table a small number of body stations
could be continually moved to the portion of the coin that is closest to the
table.

------
STATES
------
Each instance of ExponentialSpringForce possesses 4 states, which are listed
below in the appropriate category:

### DISCRETE STATES
- μₛ (Real) = Static coefficient of friction.  0.0 ≤ μₛ
- μₖ (Real) = Kinetic coefficient of friction.  0.0 ≤ μₖ ≤ μₛ

As discrete states, μₛ and μₖ can be changed during the course of a simulation
without invalidating the System topology. This feature allows μₛ and μₖ to be
altered during a simulation to model, for example, a slippery spot on the
floor.

### AUTO UPDATE DISCRETE STATES
- p₀ (Vec3) = Elastic anchor point of the frictional spring. p₀ always lies in
the contact plane.
- Sliding (Real) = Sliding state of the body station. 0.0 ≤ Sliding ≤ 1.0.
A value of 0.0 indicates that p₀ is "static" or fixed in place, in which case
μ = μₛ. A value of 1.0 indicates that p₀ is "kinetic" or sliding, in which case
μ = μₖ. A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicates that a transition from fixed to
sliding or from sliding to fixed is underway, in which case μₖ ≤ μ ≤ μₛ.
Sliding is also used to blend between friction Model 1 and Model 2 (see
above).
