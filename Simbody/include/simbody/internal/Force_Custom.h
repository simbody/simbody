/** @file
This contains the user-visible API ("handle" class) for the SimTK::Force

and is logically part of Force.h. The file assumes that
Force.h will have included all necessary declarations. **/

namespace SimTK {

/**
 * This class is used to define new force elements. To use it, you will 
 * create a class that extends Force::Custom::Implementation. Optionally, you
 * may also create a "handle" class extending Force::Custom that hides your 
 * implementation and provides a nicer API for users of your new force element.
 * Here we'll use as an example a force "MySpring" that we'll presume you will 
 * declare in a header file "MySpring.h". The MySpring constructor will take 
 * a reference to a MobilizedBody \a mobod and a spring constant \a k, and 
 * connect the origin OB of body \a mobod to the Ground origin O by a spring of
 * stiffness \a k. MySpring will apply a force of magnitude \a kx to OB, 
 * directed towards O, where x=|OB-O| is the current distance from OB to O. 
 * First we'll look at how MySpring would be used in a main program (whether by
 * you or some future user of your force element), then how you would 
 * implement it. 
 *
 * There are two possibilities: 
 *  - you supply only an %Implementation object MySpringImpl (less work 
 *    for you), or 
 *  - you supply both the %Implementation object and a handle MySpring
 *    (nicer for the user). 
 *
 * If you are planning only to use this force yourself, and perhaps just once
 * for a single application, the %Implementation-only approach is probably 
 * adequate. However, if you plan to have others use your new force object, it
 * is well worth the (minimal) extra effort to provide a handle class also to 
 * make your new force behave identically to the built-in forces that come 
 * with Simbody. In either case the %Implementation object is the same so you 
 * can add a handle later if you want. To reiterate: the handle class is 
 * completely optional; you \e must write an %Implementation class
 * but a handle class is an aesthetic addition whose main purpose is to
 * make a cleaner API for users of your force element.
 *
 * In the case where you write only the %Implementation class, a user will 
 * create an instance of that class and pass it to the generic Force::Custom 
 * constructor (this would be in main.cpp or some other piece of application
 * code):
 * @code
 *  // Using your custom force in a simulation application, no handle.
 *  #include "Simbody.h"
 *  #include "MySpring.h"
 *  using namespace SimTK;
 *  GeneralForceSubsystem forces;
 *  MobilizedBody mobod1 = MobilizedBody::Pin(...); // or whatever
 *  // ...
 *  Force::Custom spring1(forces, new MySpringImpl(mobod1,100.));
 * @endcode
 * If you also write a handle class, then the API seen by the user is the
 * same as for built-in force objects:
 * @code
 *  // Using your custom force in a simulation application, with handle.
 *  // Same as above except last line is now:
 *  MySpring spring1(forces, mobod1, 100.);
 * @endcode
 *
 * <h2>Writing the %Implementation class</h2>
 *
 * You would put the following code in MySpring.h, although you can hide it
 * elsewhere (such as in a separate .cpp file) if you provide a handle class:
 * @code
 *  // Sample implementation of a custom force Implementation class.
 *  class MySpringImpl: public Force::Custom::Implementation {
 *  public:
 *      MySpringImpl(MobilizedBody mobod, Real k)
 *      :   m_mobod(mobod), m_k(k) {}
 *
 *      virtual void calcForce(const State&         state, 
 *                             Vector_<SpatialVec>& bodyForcesInG, 
 *                             Vector_<Vec3>&       particleForcesInG, 
 *                             Vector&              mobilityForces) const 
 *      {
 *          Vec3 bodyPointInB(0,0,0); // body origin (in the body frame)
 *          Vec3 pos = m_mobod.getBodyOriginLocation(state); // in Ground frame
 *          // apply force towards origin, proportional to distance x
 *          m_mobod.applyForceToBodyPoint(state, bodyPointInB, -m_k*pos,
 *                                        bodyForcesInG);
 *      }
 *
 *      virtual Real calcPotentialEnergy(const State& state) const {
 *          Vec3 pos = m_mobod.getBodyOriginLocation(state); // in Ground
 *          Real x   = pos.norm(); // distance from Ground origin
 *          return m_k*x*x/2; // potential energy in the spring
 *      }
 *  private:
 *      MobilizedBody m_mobod;    // the body to which to apply the force
 *      Real          m_k;        // spring stiffness
 *  };
 * @endcode
 *
 * To write the code exactly as above, the compiler has to be told to look in
 * the %SimTK namespace for some of the symbols. There are a variety of ways
 * to do that; see the discussion below for details.
 * 
 * <h2>Writing the handle class</h2>
 *
 * Here is how to implement the handle class, assuming you've already 
 * written the %Implementation class MySpringImpl. You would put this 
 * code (at least the declarations) in MySpring.h, following the declaration
 * of the MySpringImpl class:
 * @code
 *  // Sample implementation of a handle class. Note: a handle class
 *  // may *not* have any data members or virtual methods.
 *  class MySpring : public Force::Custom {
 *  public:
 *      MySpring(GeneralForceSubsystem& forces, // note the "&"
 *               MobilizedBody          mobod,
 *               Real                   k) 
 *      :   Force::Custom(forces, new MySpringImpl(mobod,k)) {}
 *  };
 * @endcode
 * As you can see, the handle class is very simple and just hides the creation
 * of the implementation object. Since this removes any reference to the 
 * implementation object from the user's program, it also means you can hide
 * the implementation details completely (perhaps in a separately compiled
 * library), which has many advantages. You can add additional methods to the 
 * handle class to provide a clean API to users of your custom force; these 
 * methods will forward to the implementation object as necessary but will not 
 * expose any aspects of the implementation that are not needed by the user.
 *
 * @warning A handle class <em>must not</em> have any data members or virtual
 * methods and will not work properly if it does. Instead, store any data you
 * need in the %Implementation object.
 *
 * <h2>Getting access to symbols in the %SimTK namespace</h2>
 *
 * The examples above glossed over the naming of symbols in the SimTK namespace.
 * To write the code exactly as above you would need to precede it with
 * \c using statements to tell the compiler to look there to resolve symbols, 
 * for example:
 * @code
 *  using namespace SimTK; // search the entire namespace for symbols, or
 *  using SimTK::Real; using SimTK::Vector_; // define just particular symbols
 * @endcode
 * Either of those approaches will work, but note that this will have the same 
 * effect on user programs that include MySpring.h as it does within the header 
 * file. That may be unwanted behavior for some users who might prefer not to have
 * the namespace searched automatically, perhaps to avoid conflicts with their own
 * symbols that have the same names. If you want to avoid introducing unwanted 
 * symbols into users' compilation units, then in the header file you should 
 * refer to each symbol explicitly by its full name; that is, prepend the 
 * namespace each time the symbol is used, for example:
 * @code
 *  class MySpringImpl: public SimTK::Force::Custom::Implementation {
 *  void calcForce(const SimTK::State&                state, 
 *                 SimTK::Vector_<SimTK::SpatialVec>& bodyForcesInG, 
 *                 SimTK::Vector_<SimTK::Vec3>&       particleForcesInG, 
 *                 SimTK::Vector&                     mobilityForces) const ;
 *  };
 * @endcode
 * That is less convenient for you (and uglier) but avoids the possibility of
 * unwanted side effects in user code so should be considered if you expect
 * wide distribution of your new force element.
 *
 * Thanks to Nur Adila Faruk Senan (a.k.a. Adila Papaya) for help in clarifying
 * this documentation.
