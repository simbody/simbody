//                        SPHERE ON SPHERE CONTACT
//==============================================================================
/** This constraint represents a \e bilateral connection between a sphere on one
body and a sphere on another.

On construction you may choose whether the connection enforces rolling;
otherwise the spheres will slip against each other. There is always one position
(holonomic) constraint equation: the sphere surfaces must touch at some point.
That leaves the spheres with five unconstrained degrees of freedom (dofs) to
take on any relative orientation and to be touching at any point on their
surfaces. Optionally, there are also two velocity (nonholonomic) constraint
equations that prevent relative slip between the spheres and thus enforce
rolling. In that case there can be five position dofs but only three
unconstrained velocity dofs.

Note that this is a bilateral, unconditional connection and will push or pull
as necessary to keep the spheres in contact. If rolling is being enforced then
whatever tangential forces are necessary to keep the spheres rolling
will be generated, regardless of the normal force. These constraints can form
the basis for unilateral contact with Coulomb friction, but additional
conditions must be added to determine when they are active.

There are two mobilized bodies involved, we'll call them F and B. Either body
can move or either can be Ground; however, we will orient the signs in our
calculations so that we treat F as though it were "fixed"; for example, the
contact normal will be considered to point from F towards B, as though F were
Ground. F has a sphere attached to it with center point Sf and radius rf. B has
a sphere attached to it with center Sb and radius rb. The line between the
centers is p_SfSb, oriented from body F's sphere center to body B's sphere
center. The contact normal will be a unit vector aligned with p_SfSb.

Let d=||p_SfSb|| be the separation between the sphere centers. We define the
contact point Co to be located on the center-to-center line so that it divides
the line into two segments whose lengths are proportional to the size of the
sphere nearest each segment: <pre>
    Co = Sf + (rf/(rf+rb)) * p_SfSb
</pre>
If the contact constraint is satisfied (so that the spheres are touching), then
d=rf+rb and Co will be located at the point of contact, at a distance rf from
Sf and rb from Sb. Otherwise Co will be located along the center line with the
error distributed in proportion to the radii. Since position constraints
cannot be satisifed perfectly, this ensures that the fractional torque error
produced by applying tangential forces at a point away from the sphere surfaces
is the same for each sphere.

For any given pose, we will define a contact frame C with origin Co whose z
axis Cz is aligned with the center-to-center line, pointing from Co towards Sb.
If Sf and Sb are coincident (as can happen prior to assembly), Cz will be
chosen arbitrarily. The x and y axes Cx and Cy define the contact plane. They
are always somewhat arbitrary except for being perpendicular to Cz; don't expect
them to change smoothly. However, once chosen for a new pose, Cx and Cy are
held constant during subsequent velocity and acceleration calculations using the
same pose. Cx and Cy are used to parameterize the slip velocity and the
tangential forces; the two tangential multipliers are measure numbers in the Cx
and Cy directions. The instantaneous contact frame in Ground is available as the
transform X_GC.

The contact constraints here are enforced by a normal multiplier acting along
Cz, and optionally two tangential multipliers acting along Cx and Cy
respectively. Together these three multipliers can be interpreted as a force
expressed in frame C, and applied equal and opposite to bodies F and B at
their material points coincident with contact point Co.

The assembly condition is the same as the position constraint: the surfaces
of the spheres must meet at some point. There is no assembly
condition for the tangential constraints since they do not restrict the
allowable pose during assembly. **/

/** @name                       Construction
Methods in this section refer both to constructors, and to methods that can
be used to set or change contruction (Topology-stage) parameters; these
specify the values assigned by default to the corresponding state variables.
Note:
  - Changing one of these default parameters invalidates the containing
    System's topology, meaning that realizeTopology() will have to be called
    and a new State obtained before subsequent use.
  - The set...() methods return a reference to "this" %SphereOnSphereContact
    element (in the manner of an assignment operator) so they can be chained in
    a single expression.

The default parameters can be overridden in any given State, and modified
without affecting Topology; see the "Runtime Changes" section below. **/

    This is the location of the sphere center on \a mobod_F, given as a vector

    will be present in a default State; you can modify it later.
@param      mobod_B

These refer to Position-stage discrete state variables that determine the sphere

If these are not set explicitly, the parameters are set to those provided in the

Note:
  - Changing one of these parameters invalidates the given State's

    Stage::Time after the parameter change. That ensures that position
    constraint errors will be recalculated before they are used.
  - The set...() methods here return a const reference to "this"
    %SphereOnSphereContact element (in the manner of an assignment operator,
