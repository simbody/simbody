/** Three mobilities -- unrestricted orientation modeled as a 1-2-3 body-fixed
Euler angle sequence, though with a singularity when the middle angle is +/- 90
degrees. Use MobilizedBody::Ball for a similar joint that is free of
singularities.

This mobilizer does not provide any translation, so the parent's F frame and
child's M frame origins will always be coincident. (MobilizedBody::Bushing is
defined like Gimbal but adds translation.) When q0=q1=q2=0, the F and M
frames are aligned. Then the generalized coordinates q should be interpreted
as a series of rotation angles in radians: q0 is a rotation about the x axis,
then q1 is a rotation about the now-rotated y axis, and then q2 is a rotation
about the now twice-rotated z axis. The generalized speeds u for the %Gimbal
mobilizer are the time derivatives of
the generalized coordinates, that is, u=qdot. Note that this is different than
the choice of generalized speeds used for MobilizedBody::Ball, where the
angular velocity vector is used as the three generalized speeds. (Euler angle
derivatives are \e not the same as angular velocity, except when q=0.)

While this mobilizer provides arbitrary orientation, the Euler angle
derivatives are singular when q1 (the middle rotation) is near +/- Pi/2. That
means you should not attempt to do any dynamics in that configuration; if you
can't be sure the motion will remain away from that region, you should use
a MobilizedBody::Ball instead, which uses quaternions to ensure
singularity-free rotation.

Here is another way to describe the meaning of a %Gimbal mobilizer:
A %Gimbal between frames F and M is exactly equivalent to a series
of three pin joints using two massless intermediate bodies B1 and B2. The
first pin joint rotates about the common Fx and B1x axes. The second rotates
about the common B1y and B2y axes. The last one rotates about the common B2z
and Mz axes. Other than performance (which is somewhat better if you use the
%Gimbal), the pins-and-intermediate bodies system generates exactly the same
generalized coordinates and generalized speeds as the %Gimbal.
