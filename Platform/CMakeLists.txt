# Simbody/Platform
#
# Simbody has dependencies on several low-level packages
# for which the details differ on different platforms.
# Dependencies are:
#    - pthreads
#    - Lapack
# Pthreads is standard on Linux platforms, and close enough
# on Macs. On Windows we have to supply our own.
# We provide our own high-performance Lapack library 
# for Windows; Linux and Macs are expected to have one.
