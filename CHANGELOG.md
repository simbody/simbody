Simbody Changelog and Release Notes
===================================

This is not a comprehensive list of changes but rather a hand-curated collection of the more notable ones. For a comprehensive history, see the [Simbody GitHub repo](https://github.com/simbody/simbody). You can use the release dates below to find all the PRs and issues that were included in a particular release. 

**Heads up**: Simbody 3.5 was the last release that will build with C++03 (patch builds with version numbers like 3.5.1, will work too). For 3.6 and above we will permit Simbody developers to use C++11, restricted to the subset that is currently supported on all our platforms. Since the C++03 and C++11 ABIs are not compatible, code that uses Simbody 3.6 will also have to be built with C++11. Time to move up, if you haven't already!


3.6 (in development)
--------------------
* Forced GCC to be at least 4.9.0, so that new C++11 features like regular
  expressions can be used (pr #485).
* Minimum Ubuntu version supported 14.04 LTS (Trusty), with a [manual update of GCC](http://askubuntu.com/questions/466651/how-do-i-use-the-latest-gcc-on-ubuntu-14-04).
* Recommended minimum Ubuntu version : 15.04 (Vivid), that is shipped with GCC 4.9.2.
* Added mixin classes `ResetOnCopy<T>` and `ReinitOnCopy<T>` to force default
  construction or reinitialization of data members on copy construction or copy
  assignment, without requiring a user written copy constructor and copy
  assignment operator just to get those reinitializations done.
* Added clone() method to `SimTK::Function_` base class and implemented it for
  Simbody-defined concrete Function classes. Made concrete Function members
  non-const to permit assignment, and modified Function_<T>::Step to allow
  changing its parameters after construction.
* Added C++11 features to the `SimTK::Array_` container including `std::initializer_list` construction, move construction, move assignment, and `emplace` methods.
* Prevented copy construction of `Array_<T>` from `Array_<T2>` unless T2 is *implicitly*
  convertible to T. Previously this was allowed if there was any conversion possible
  even if it was explicit. Array_ was being too relaxed about this, causing hidden 
  copies to occur. 
* Added CloneOnWritePtr smart pointer (acts like ClonePtr but with deferred cloning).
* Updated ClonePtr and ReferencePtr APIs to follow C++11 standard smart pointer
  terminology. This required deprecating some existing methods and operators, so
  you can expect to get annoying warnings until you switch to the new API. 
* Possible BREAKING CHANGE: ClonePtr's operator==() previously delegated
  to the managed object; now it just operates on the managed pointer as is done 
  in other smart pointers. Consequently now only a clone() method is required for a type
  to be contained in a ClonePtr; previously it had to support comparison also.
* Make doxygen run silently so errors will be easier to see.
* Added new methods to `Pathname` class for interpreting pathnames against a specified working directory instead
of the current working directory (thanks to Carmichael Ong). See [Issue #264](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/264) and [PR #307](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/307). 
* Added the ability to parallelize forces, robustness/performance improvements
to ParallelExecutor, mutex state lock.
[PR #414](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/414).
* Added move constructor and move assignment to State (very fast).
* Added "stage version" counters for time, q, u, and z that are incremented
  whenever one of these changes.
* Separated time-independent position and kinematics calculations so that 
  they are not invalidated by a time change. These can also be initiated
  explicitly with new methods `realizePositionKinematics()` and
  `realizeVelocityKinematics()`. They are invalidated by a change to q or
  to u, respectively. 
* Modified floating point-to-String conversions to use lossless number of 
  digits by default. An attempt to use the default type-to-String conversion 
  when no stream insertion operator is available is now a runtime rather than
  compile time error. [PR #459](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/459).
* Upgraded `SimTK::Xml` from class to namespace; local classes like `Xml::Element`
  were promoted to namespace level within Xml. This was necessary to untangle
  Array_ and Xml classes which can be mutually dependent. This change is backwards
  compatible for those following the recommended use of the previously-available
  `Xml::Document` typedef instead of Xml directly. Otherwise you will have to change
  uses of `SimTK::Xml` to `SimTK::Xml::Document`. Also any `using SimTK::Xml;`
  must be removed or replaced with `using namespace SimTK::Xml` or
  `using SimTK::Xml::Document` depending on the intent. 
  [PR #460](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/460)
* Improved `NiceTypeName<T>::namestr()` to produce a canonicalized name that is
  the same on all platforms (with a few exceptions). Added `xmlstr()` method to
  make an XML-friendly modification of `namestr()` that replaces angle brackets
  with curly braces. Added a new regression test to verify that the names come
  out right. [PR #461](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/461)
* Added helper class IteratorRange to use range-based for loops with a pair of
  iterators. [PR#467](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/467)
* Added the method `State::isConsistent()` to compare two states
  [PR #469](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/469).
* Started using RPATH on OSX so that users need not set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to
  run `simbody-visualizer` or the example executables, regardless of where you
  install Simbody.
* Improved the ability to find the simbody-visualizer executable when Simbody
  is installed in non-standard locations or if the Simbody installation is
  relocated (even to different computers). This enhancement is only for
  non-Windows operating systems.
* Fixed a bug when compiling on macOS (OSX) with SDK MacOSX10.12.sdk, related
  to the POSIX function `clock_gettime()`.
  [Issue #523](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/523),
  [PR 524](#https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/524)
* Replaced usages of pthreads with C++11 classes. Removed the AtomicInteger and
  ThreadLocal classes.
* (There are more that haven't been added yet)


3.5.3 (15 June 2015)
-------------------
This is the release that shipped with OpenSim 3.3.
* Small changes to allow compilation with Visual Studio 2015 (PRs [#395](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/395) and [#396](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/396)).
* Fixed a problem with SpatialInertia::shift() with non-zero COM offset, see issue [#334](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/334). This also affected calcCompositeBodyInertias(). These are not commonly used.
* Fixed a problem with VectorIterator which could unnecessary copying, possibly affecting mesh handling performance. See issue [#349](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/349). 


3.5.2 (15 May 2015)
-------------------
Same as 3.5.1 except on 64 bit Windows which has a patched version of Lapack that
addresses an error handling problem that caused trouble for some OpenSim users.
This is a patch to Lapack 3.4.2 (64 bit) to fix the bug discussed in [Issue #177](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/177) and [PR #342](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/342).
There were two functions where convergence failures incorrectly caused an abort (XERBLA in Lapack-speak). See discussion on Lapack forum:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4586
This Lapack DLL is binary compatible with the previous one, same functions and ordinals.


3.5.1 (31 Dec 2014)
-------------------
This patch release fixed an installation problem but is otherwise identical to 3.5.
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a Mac installation problem reported [here](https://github.com/osrf/homebrew-simulation/issues/33).
See [PR #321](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/321). Probably affects Linux too; we think it is due to a change in CMake behavior, noticed with CMake 3.1 but could have happened earlier.
* Updated Travis-CI script to attempt installation to catch these problems earlier. See [PR #322](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/pull/322).


3.5 (18 Dec 2014)
-----------------
This release focused primarily on infrastructure for and prototyping of rigid contact and impact, and the development of examples showing how to perform task space control using Simbody. These two projects were supported by our DARPA research subcontract with Open Source Robotics Foundation, and were integrated with Gazebo. Further development for rigid contact is required for smooth integration into Simbody; this is planned for Simbody 4.0 and only the bravest among you should attempt to use rigid contact before then. The task space control examples `TaskSpaceControl-UR10` and `TaskSpaceControl-Atlas` can be found in the Simbody examples directory.

Chris Dembia integrated Nikolaus Hansen's [Covariant Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy](https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaesintro.html) (CMA-ES) global optimizer into Simbody's existing Optimizer class framework, and implemented a multithreading capability for it. This is ready to use and we would like feedback. 

There were numerous smaller improvements to Simbody since the previous release, in build and installation, documentation, performance, bug fixes, and small enhancements. There are no known incompatibilities with previous release 3.4.1 and we highly recommend that you upgrade.

### New features
* Added Task Space control examples (pr #237 #238) (work supported by OSRF)
* Added IMU (orientation) tracking assembly condition for IK (pr #239)
* Added STL file reader to PolygonalMesh class (issue #57, pr #176)
* Added CMA-ES global optimizer with multithreading support (pr #249 #253 #267 #268)
* Initial rigid contact support (pr #137). Includes a collection of new unilateral constraints and a specialized solver. Not yet well integrated into Simbody overall. (work supported by OSRF)
* Implemented PLUS method impact handling (issue #115 #205, pr #226) (work supported by OSRF)

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed bug in orientation of non-camera-facing text in visualizer (issue #214, pr #215)
* Fixed bug in mesh triangulation (issue #198, pr #199)
* Fixed Assembler bugs; could sometimes make initial solution worse or report spurious failure (issue #164 #167, pr #165 #168)
* Fixed Debug visualizer name to have "_d" (issue #5)

### Misc. improvements
* Improved regression test timing framework to make it useful for multithreaded tests (pr #265)
* Much nicer Doxygen for Rotation class (issue #183)
* Reorganized Simbody example programs (pr #238)
* Added HalfSpace-ConvexImplicitSurface contact tracker (issue #232, pr #233)
* Added methods for principal curvatures and directions on arbitrary implicit surface (pr #231)
* Added missing calcContactPatch() functionality for Hertz contacts (pr #224)
* Added Brick ContactGeometry shape (pr #218)
* Added several new bilateral constraints useful as the basis for unilateral constraints in rigid contact: Constraint::PointOnPlaneContact, SphereOnPlaneContact, SphereOnSphereContact,  LineOnLineContact (edge/edge) (pr #137 #169)
* Improved constraint performance for several basic constraints (pr #137)
* Moved install instructions to README.md where they can be kept up to date (pr #144 and others)
* Replaced distance constraint equations to use length rather than length^2 (issue #3). This improves scaling when distance constraint is combined with other constraints.
* Numerous improvements to build, install, documentation, and performance.
* Added CONTRIBUTING.md file explaining ways to contribute to the Simbody project.


3.4.1 (31 Mar 2014)
-------------------

This is primarily a release for improving our build and install process to comply with Debian's requirements. Thanks to José Rivero and Steve Peters at Open Source Robotics Foundation, and Chris Dembia at Stanford for the bulk of this effort.

* Fixed `SimbodyMatterSubsystem::getTotalCentrifugalForces()` (issue #112, pr #116).
* Many changes to build and install, mostly affecting Linux and OSX. Should now conform better to standards on those platforms and in general be better and finding its dependencies. (pr #114 #118 #120 #121 #122 #127 #130 #131 #133, issue #48 #68 #92 #113) 
* Started using the -Werror flag (treat warnings as errors) in Travis builds to ensure that we are warning-free. (issue #128, pr #129 #131)
* Compile with C++11 enabled by default. However, the code will still build in C++03. (pr #123, #126)


3.3.1 (21 Jan 2014)
-------------------
This is the first release built for use in Open Source Robotic Foundation's Gazebo robot simulator and is also the version of Simbody that ships with OpenSim 3.2. It incorporates many fixes and enhancements prompted by the integration effort with OSRF, and a new Debian package builder for smooth incorporation into the Gazebo build.

* Improved matrix/vector documentation and reorganized source to break up large files (pr #70 #76 #77 #78 #87)
* Improved Force::Gravity to make it more flexible and avoid NaNs (pr #33)
* Fix multiplyByMInv() to be usable in forces and controllers; now only requires state to be realized to position stage. (issue #29, pr #31)
* Make MobilizedBody::lock() and lockAt() method immediately modify the state (issue #20, pr #23)
* Added Debian/Ubuntu package building (pr #24 #32 #52 #58 #59 #64)
* Improved TestMultibodyPerformance timing information (pr #22)

* Added uninstall (issue #104, pr #106)
* Visualizer name changed to "simbody-visualizer" (issue #27, pr #53)
* Added torque-limited motor examples
* Added ability to lock/unlock mobilizers and disble/enable Motion objects on the fly, for flexible mixed forward/inverse dynamics
* Re-engineered Force::Gravity for speed and run time flexibility (for Gazebo)
* Extended Force::Gravity to support gravity compensation controllers
* Allow runtime changes to MobilityLinear{Spring,Damper} (for Gazebo)
* Added Theo Jansen Strandbeest example
* Ported some Gazebo regression tests to Simbody's regression suite.
* Added dirent.h support on Windows (for directory searching)
* Many bug fixes, doxygen improvements, and small performance improvements
* Added Semi-Explicit Euler integrators, with and without error control (for Gazebo)
* Added O(n) methods for task space Jacobians
