Description: SimTK multibody dynamics API - shared library
 Simbody is a SimTK toolset providing general multibody dynamics capability,
 that is, the ability to solve Newton's 2nd law F=ma in any set of generalized
 coordinates subject to arbitrary constraints. (That's Isaac himself in the
 oval.) Simbody is provided as an open source, object-oriented C++ API and
 delivers high-performance, accuracy-controlled science/engineering-quality
 results.
