Not implemented yet:
- various functions needed for projection in WRMS norm
  (in cpodes_dense and cpodes_lapack)
- function to compute consistent y' for implicit-form ODEs
  (in cpodes_ic)
- add some more optional I/O functions for IC calculation

More tests needed:
- test quadrature integration
- test BAND linear solver for CP_IMPL case
- test BANDPRE and BBDPRE preconditioner modules
- recheck SPGMR, SPBCG, and SPTFQMR (particularly the CP_IMPL case) and test.

Under consideration:
- do I want to add a function to change from its default value of 1.0 the
  variable dqincfac (cpSpilsDQjtvImpl in cpodes_spils), like it's done in IDA?
- automatic stiff-nonstiff switch (through nonlinear solver switch)?
  We could add a Lipschitz constant estimator for this. But what about the
  influence of problem size (when using DQ Jacobians) or the relative cost
  of fct/Jac. evals (when the user provides the Jacobian)?

NOTES:

- At this time, unless we allocate one additional vector, we cannot return the
  proper estimated local error vector if the error estimate was actually projected.
  (i.e. we still return acor/tq[2] when we really should return P*acor/tq[2], but we
  do not have P*acor anymore -- it was stored into a temporary vector).

- To save an additional function evaluation at the projected state (i.e. finding
  yP' such that yP' = f(t,yP) or F(t, yP', yP) = 0, the latter also requiring
  a nonlinear solve with a Jacobian which is not readily available), we use a
  special trick in applying the projection correction (i.e. we do something slightly
  different than it's done for the application of the NLS correction) => potential
  problems when using Adams.
