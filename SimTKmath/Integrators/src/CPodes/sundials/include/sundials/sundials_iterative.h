 * Function: ModifiedGS
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * ModifiedGS performs a modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
 * of the N_Vector v[k] against the p unit N_Vectors at
 * v[k-1], v[k-2], ..., v[k-p].
 *
 * v is an array of (k+1) N_Vectors v[i], i=0, 1, ..., k.
 * v[k-1], v[k-2], ..., v[k-p] are assumed to have L2-norm
 * equal to 1.
 *
 * h is the output k by k Hessenberg matrix of inner products.
 * This matrix must be allocated row-wise so that the (i,j)th
 * entry is h[i][j]. The inner products (v[i],v[k]),
 * i=i0, i0+1, ..., k-1, are stored at h[i][k-1]. Here
 * i0=MAX(0,k-p).
 *
 * k is the index of the vector in the v array that needs to be
 * orthogonalized against previous vectors in the v array.
 *
 * p is the number of previous vectors in the v array against
 * which v[k] is to be orthogonalized.
 *
 * new_vk_norm is a pointer to memory allocated by the caller to
 * hold the Euclidean norm of the orthogonalized vector v[k].
 *
 * If (k-p) < 0, then ModifiedGS uses p=k. The orthogonalized
 * v[k] is NOT normalized and is stored over the old v[k]. Once
 * the orthogonalization has been performed, the Euclidean norm
 * of v[k] is stored in (*new_vk_norm).
 *
 * ModifiedGS returns 0 to indicate success. It cannot fail.

 * Function: QRfact
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * QRfact performs a QR factorization of the Hessenberg matrix H.
 *
 * n is the problem size; the matrix H is (n+1) by n.
 *
 * h is the (n+1) by n Hessenberg matrix H to be factored. It is
 * stored row-wise.
 *
 * q is an array of length 2*n containing the Givens rotations
 * computed by this function. A Givens rotation has the form:
 * | c  -s |
 * | s   c |.
 * The components of the Givens rotations are stored in q as
 * (c, s, c, s, ..., c, s).
 *
 * job is a control flag. If job==0, then a new QR factorization
 * is performed. If job!=0, then it is assumed that the first
 * n-1 columns of h have already been factored and only the last
 * column needs to be updated.
 *
 * QRfact returns 0 if successful. If a zero is encountered on
 * the diagonal of the triangular factor R, then QRfact returns
 * the equation number of the zero entry, where the equations are
 * numbered from 1, not 0. If QRsol is subsequently called in
 * this situation, it will return an error because it could not
 * divide by the zero diagonal entry.

 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Function: QRsol
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * QRsol solves the linear least squares problem
 *
 * min (b - H*x, b - H*x), x in R^n,
 *
 * where H is a Hessenberg matrix, and b is in R^(n+1).
 * It uses the QR factors of H computed by QRfact.
 *
 * n is the problem size; the matrix H is (n+1) by n.
 *
 * h is a matrix (computed by QRfact) containing the upper
 * triangular factor R of the original Hessenberg matrix H.
 *
 * q is an array of length 2*n (computed by QRfact) containing
 * the Givens rotations used to factor H.
 *
 * b is the (n+1)-vector appearing in the least squares problem
 * above.
 *
 * On return, b contains the solution x of the least squares
 * problem, if QRsol was successful.
 *
 * QRsol returns a 0 if successful.  Otherwise, a zero was
 * encountered on the diagonal of the triangular factor R.
 * In this case, QRsol returns the equation number (numbered
 * from 1, not 0) of the zero entry.
