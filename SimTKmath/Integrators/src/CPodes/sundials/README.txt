                            SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers

The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS consists of solvers CVODE
(for ODE systems), CVODES (ODE with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
IDA (for differential-algebraic systems), and KINSOL (for nonlinear
algebraic systems).

The various solvers of this family share many subordinate modules.
For this reason, it is organized as a family, with a directory structure
that exploits that sharing. Each individual solver includes documentation
on installation, along with full usage documentation.

The following is a list of the solver packages presently available.

CVODE:  A solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems y' = f(t,y).

CVODES: A solver for stiff and non-stiff ODE systems with sensitivity
        analysis capabilities.

IDA:    A solver for differential-algebraic systems F(t,y,y') = 0.

KINSOL: A solver for nonlinear algebraic systems F(u) = 0.

Warning to users who receive more than one of these individual solvers
at different times: The mixing of old and new versions SUNDIALS may fail.
To avoid such failures, obtain all desired solvers at the same time.

For installation directions see the file INSTALL_NOTES.

For additional information on a particular solver, see the README file
in the solver directory (e.g. src/cvode/README).
