/** An Integrator is an object that can advance the State of a System 
through time. This is an abstract class. Subclasses implement a variety of 
different integration methods, which vary in their speed, accuracy, stability, 
and various other properties.

<h3>Usage</h3>

An Integrator is most often used in combination with a TimeStepper.  The
TimeStepper automates much of the work of using an Integrator: invoking it 
repeatedly to advance time, calling event handlers, reinitializing the 
Integrator as necessary, and so on.  A typical use of an Integrator generally 
resembles the following:

@code
    // Instantiate an Integrator subclass which is appropriate for your problem.
    VerletIntegrator integ(system);
    // Set configuration options on the Integrator.
    integ.setAccuracy(1e-3);
    // Create a TimeStepper and use it to run the simulation.
    TimeStepper stepper(system, integ);
    stepper.initialize(initialState);
    stepper.stepTo(finalTime);
@endcode

<h3>Mathematical Overview</h3>

Given a continuous system of differential equations for state variables y, and
optionally a manifold (set of algebraic equations) on which the solution must
lie, an Integrator object will advance that system through time. If the full 
system is continuous, this is sufficient. However, most interesting systems 
consist of both continuous and discrete equations, in which case the overall 
time advancement is handled by a TimeStepper object which will use an 
Integrator as an "inner loop" for advancing the system across continuous 
intervals between discrete updates. In that case, in addition to continuous 
state variables y there will be a set of discrete variables d which are held 
constant during an integration interval.

The continuous part of the system is an ODE-on-a-manifold system suitable for 
solution via coordinate projection[1], structured like this:
        (1)  y' = f(d;t,y)        differential equations
        (2)  0  = c(d;t,y)        algebraic equations (manifold is c=0)
        (3)  e  = e(d;t,y)        event triggers (watch for zero crossings)
with initial conditions t0,y0 such that c=0. The "d;" is a reminder that the 
overall system is dependent on discrete variables d as well as y, but d cannot 
change during a continuous interval.

By "ODE on a manifold" we mean that the ODE (1) automatically satisfies the 
condition that IF c==0, THEN c'=0, where
    c'=partial(c)/partial(t) + [partial(c)/partial(y)]*y'.
This is a less stringent condition than an ODE with "first integral" invariant,
in which c'=0 regardless of whether c=0.

[1] Hairer, Lubich, Wanner, "Geometric Numerical Integration: 
Structure-Preserving Algorithms for Ordinary Differential Equations", 2nd ed., 
section IV.4, pg 109ff, Springer, 2006.

The discrete variables d are updated by the time stepper upon occurrence of 
specific events, which terminate a continuous interval. The Integrator detects
these using a set of scalar-valued event trigger functions shown as equation 
(3) above. An event trigger function for a particular event must be designed so
that it has a zero crossing when the event occurs. The integrator can thus 
watch for sign changes in event triggers and terminate the current step when a
zero crossing occurs, notifying the system and giving it a chance to handle the
event; that is, update its state variables discontinuously.

The zero crossings of continuous event trigger functions will be isolated 
quickly; discontinuous ones have to be "binary chopped" which is more expensive
but they will still work.

We are given a set of weights W for the y's, and a set of tolerances T for the
constraint errors. Given an accuracy specification (like 0.1%), the integrators
here are expected to solve for y(t) such that the local error 
|W*yerr|_RMS <= accuracy, and |T*c(t,y)|_RMS <= accuracy at all times.
