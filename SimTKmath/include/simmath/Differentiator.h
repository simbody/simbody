/**
 * Given a function f(y), where f, y or both can be vectors, calculate the
 * derivative (gradient, Jacobian) df/dy.
 *
 * Calculation is done using numerical differencing, which should be considered
 * a last resort for cases in which the analytic derivative is unavailable.
 * (Note that you can obtain an analytic gradient automatically from the source
 * code for f using automatic differentiation methods like complex step
 * derivatives, ADIFOR, etc.).
 *
 * @par Theory and Implementation
 *
 * The SimTK::Differentiator class uses methods adapted from the book
 * Practical Optimization by Gill, Murray, and Wright (1981), section 8.6
 * (339ff) and Numerical Recipies in C++ 2nd ed. (2002) section 5.7 (192ff).
 * Here is a summary:
 *  - We want to differentiate a function f(y) whose estimated relative
 *    accuracy eps is known (e.g. eps=1e-6). (We'll treat y as a scalar here
 *    but for vector y this is done for one element yi at a time.)
 *  - We need to know what perturbation h to use for calculating an estimate
 *    of df/dy that optimally balances roundoff error (h too small) with
 *    truncation error (h too big).
 *  - First guess at h depends on the order of the numerical method: either
 *    forward difference (1st order) or central difference (2nd order). For
 *    1st order, h0=eps^(1/2); for 2nd order h0=eps^(1/3).
 *  - Now we have to make sure that we can compute y+h reliably. If y is very
 *    large, we can not allow h to be too small. We calculate a scaled
 *    perturbation h1=h0*max(y, 0.1). The 0.1 allows a small y to pull down
 *    the step size <em>a little</em>; but it is dangerous to go much lower
 *    because a very small y might just be zero plus noise.
 *  - Finally, the step size should be exactly representable as a power of 2.
 *    Conceptually, this is just h=(y+h1)-y although one must be careful to
 *    stop the compiler from cleverly "simplifying" this expression.
 *    Differentiator uses a C++ volatile variable for that purpose.
 *
 * Then the derivative, gradient element, or Jacobian column is computed
 * as df/dy=[f(x+h)-f(x)]/h (1st order) or df/dy=[f(x+h)-f(x-h)]/(2h)
 * (2nd order).
