//                          MULTIBODY GRAPH MAKER
//==============================================================================
/** Construct a reasonably good spanning-tree-plus-constraints structure for
modeling a given set of bodies and joints with a generalized coordinate 
multibody system like Simbody. Each body has a unique name; each joint 
connects two distinct bodies with one designated as the "parent" body and
the other the "child". We will output a spanning tree with Ground as the root,
containing a mobilizer for every body. Each mobilizer corresponds to one of
the joints from the input and has an "inboard" (topologically closer to Ground)
and "outboard" (further from Ground) body, chosen from the parent and child
bodies of the joint but possibly reordered in which case the mobilizer is 
marked as "reversed". Additional "free" mobilizers are added as needed between 
bodies and Ground so that there is a path from every body in the inboard 
direction all the way to Ground.

<h3>Results</h3>
The output is 
  -# A sequence of mobilizers (tree joints) in ascending order from
Ground to a set of terminal bodies. Every input body will be mobilized by one
of these, and there may also be some additional mobilized "slave" bodies.
  -# A set of constraints, representing either welds to attach slave bodies
to their masters, or loop joint constraints that correspond to particular input
joints.
  -# A correspondence between input bodies and mobilized bodies, with some
mobilized bodies designated as slaves to particular master input bodies. That
is, more than one mobilized body may correspond to the same input body.
  -# A correspondence between mobilizers and input joints, with some extra
mobilizers having been added to connect base bodies to Ground.
  -# Statistics and diagnostics.

Then to build a multibody model
  -# Run through the mobilizers in order, adding
one mobilized body to the tree each time, setting the "reversed" flag if 
appropriate (that just affects the interpretation of the generalized 
coordinates). Mass properties and joint information are obtained from the 
original bodies and joints; they are not stored here.
  -# Run through the list of constraints adding master-slave welds or loop 
joint constraints as indicated.

<h3>Inputs</h3>
  - bodies: name, mass, mustBeBaseBody flag
  - joints: name, type, parent body, child body, mustBeLoopJoint flag
  - joint type: name, # dofs, haveGoodLoopJoint flag
  - names for the Ground body and important joint types weld and free

The first body you add is assumed to be Ground and its name is used for 
recognizing Ground connections later in joints. The default names for weld
and free joints are, not surprisingly, "weld" and "free" but you can change
them.

<h3>Loop joints</h3>
Normally every joint produces a corresponding mobilizer. A joint that would
form a loop is marked as such, and then its child body is split to form a new
"slave" body that can be mobilized by the joint. We expect that in the 
constructed multibody model, a master body and its slaves will be reconnected
via weld constraints. This provides for uniform treatment of all joints, such
as providing pin joint coordinates that can wrap. However, for some joint types
that doesn't matter because the multibody system has equally good "loop joint"
constraints. For example, Simbody's Ball mobilizer uses quaternions for 
orientation and hence has no wrapping; it can be replaced with a Ball constraint
which removes the 3-dof mobilizer and 6 weld constraint equations, leaving just
3 translational constraints and indistinguishable behavior. Similarly a loop-
closing Weld joint can just be replaced by a Weld constraint, and a loop-
closing Free joint can simply be ignored.

The algorithm normally decides which joints are the loop-breakers, however you
can specify in the input that certain joints must be loop joints.

<h3>Massless bodies</h3>
Massless bodies can be very useful in defining compound joints, by composing
pin and slider joints, for example. This is fine in an internal coordinate code
as long as no massless (or inertialess) body is a terminal (most outboard) body
in the spanning tree. (Terminal massless bodies are OK if their inboard joint
has no dofs, i.e. is a weld mobilizer.) Bodies can have a mass provided; if a
movable body has zero mass the algorithm will try to avoid ending any branch of 
the spanning tree there. If it fails, the resulting spanning tree is no good and
an exception will be thrown. If no mass is provided we assume it is 1.

<h3>Base bodies</h3>
A body in the spanning tree that is directly connected to Ground is called a
"base" body. If its mobilizer is a free joint then it can be given an arbitrary
pose with respect to Ground and everything outboard of it moves together. This
is a nice property and you can influence this choice by providing an explicit
joint to Ground or designating some bodies as base bodies. Note that although 
you will then have a set of generalized coordinates permitting you to place 
these bodies arbitrarily, there is no guarantee that such placement will satisfy
constraints. If you don't designate base bodies, the algorithm will pick
them heuristically, which often leads to a good choice. The heuristic is to
pick the body that has the most children but does not itself appear as a child.
Failing that, pick the body that has the most children. In case of tie, pick
the first body among the tied ones.

<h3>Ground body</h3>
The first body you supply in the input will be interpreted as the Ground body.
Its name will be used to recognize joints that connect other bodies to Ground.
Typical names are "ground" or "world".

<h3>Levels</h3>
Each body in the spanning tree will be assigned a level, an integer that 
measures how many edges must be traversed to get from the body to Ground.
Ground is at level 0, bodies that have a direct connection to Ground (base
bodies) are at level 1, bodies whose mobilizer connects them to base bodies
are at level 2, and so on. Multibody models need to be constructed in order
of increasing level, so that the inboard body is already in the tree when the
outboard body is added. We consider the level of a mobilizer to be
the same as the level of its outboard body. Loop joints are not mobilizers and
do not have a level.

    @param[in]      mustBeLoopJoint
        If you feel strongly that this joint should be chosen as a loop joint,
        set this flag. In that case the joint will not appear in the list of
        joints that are candidates for mobilizers (tree joints). Only after the
        tree has been successfully built will this joint be added, either using
        a loop joint equivalent if one is available, or by splitting the child
        body into master and slave otherwise. In the latter case this joint 
        \e will be made into a mobilizer but a loop weld joint will be added
        to attach the child slave body to its master.  
    @param[in]      userRef
        This is a generic user reference pointer that is kept with the joint
        and can be used by the caller to map back to his or her own data 
        structure containing joint information.
