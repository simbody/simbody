//==============================================================================
/** This class will create a smooth surface that approximates a two-argument
function F(X,Y) from a given set of samples of that function on a rectangular
grid with regular or irregular spacing. This is useful both for function
interpolation and to provide height-mapped terrain surfaces. See the related
class BicubicFunction if you need to satisfy the SimTK::Function interface.
A single BicubicSurface can be shared among multiple accessors and threads
once constructed.

@image html BicubicSurface1.png "A single-patch bicubic surface"

A bicubic surface interpolation is used to approximate the function
between the sample points. That is desirable for simulation use because it is
continuous up to the second derivative, providing smoothly varying first
derivatives, and a very smooth surface. The third derivatives will be
discontinuous between grid boundaries; all higher derivatives are zero.

The user need only provide two vectors x and y defining the sample points,
and a matrix f that defines the value of the function at each sample (you can
think of that as the height Z of the surface over the X-Y plane). If the
samples along both axes are regularly spaced, x and y can be defined just by
giving the spacing; otherwise, the sample locations are given explicitly.

<h3>Usage</h3>
The following code generates an unsmoothed and smoothed surface using a 3x4
grid of bicubic patches from a matrix of 4x5 irregularly-spaced sample points:
@code
    const int Nx = 4, Ny = 5;
    const Real xData[Nx]    = { .1, 1, 2, 4 };
    const Real yData[Ny]    = { -3, -2, 0, 1, 3 };
    const Real fData[Nx*Ny] = { 1,   2,   3,   3,   2,
                               1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.1,
                                1,   2,   7,   3,   2,
                               1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 3.2, 2.2 };
    const Vector x(Nx,    xData);
    const Vector y(Ny,    yData);
    const Matrix f(Nx,Ny, fData);
    BicubicSurface surfaceThroughSamples(x, y, f);
    BicubicSurface smoothedSurface(x, y, f, 1);

    // Evaluate the surface at (.5,.5):
    Real val = smoothedSurface.calcValue(Vec2(.5,.5));
@endcode

When accessing the surface repeatedly, you can significantly improve performance
by maintaining a "hint" object that allows for very fast repeated access to the
same patch, a very common access pattern. Alternatively, use a BicubicFunction
as the interface to your BicubicSurface; in that case the hint is managed for
you automatically. Here is an example of explicit hint usage:
@code
    PatchHint hint;
    val = smoothedSurface.calcValue(Vec2(.5,.6), hint);
    val = smoothedSurface.calcValue(Vec2(.51,.61), hint);
@endcode

Additional methods are provided for obtaining the surface normals, and all the
surface partial derivatives. Advanced users can obtain principal curvature
directions, and performance statistics, among other specialized functions.

If you want to visualize the surface, you can ask it to generate a polygonal
mesh (with optional control over the resolution). That mesh can be used to
generate a DecorativeMesh compatible with the Simbody Visualizer. This example
creates a mesh of the smoothed surface, then places it on the Ground body so
that the Visualizer will pick it up.
@code
    PolygonalMesh smoothedMesh = smoothedSurface.createPolygonalMesh();
    matter.Ground().addBodyDecoration(Vec3(0), // place at origin
        DecorativeMesh(smoothedMesh)
            .setRepresentation(DecorativeGeometry::Wireframe)
            .setColor(Blue));
@endcode

<h3>Discussion</h3>
Graphically if the defining sample vectors and matrices were laid next to each
other consistently with how the surface is computed the diagram would look
like this: <pre>
             y(0)       y(1)    ...   y(ny-1)
            ------     ------         --------
    x(0)  |  f(0,0)     f(0,1)  ...   f(0,ny-1)
    x(1)  |  f(1,0)     f(1,1)  ...   f(1,ny-1)
     .    |    .          .              .
     .    |    .          .              .
     .    |    .          .              .
  x(nx-1) | f(nx-1,0)  f(nx-1,1)    f(nx-1,ny-1)
</pre>
such that f(i,j)=F(x(i),y(j)).

Note that the each XY location can only have a unique value associated with it
-- cave-like structures cannot be represented using this interpolation method.

A bicubic surface interpolation requires the partial derivatives
fx=Df/Dx, fy=Df/Dy and fxy=Dfx/Dy=D^2f/DxDy at each of the grid points. If you
already know those, you can provide them directly. However, in most cases you
will only know the sample points and not the derivatives. You can provide
just the sample points and BicubicSurface will estimate the derivatives
automatically. For the interested reader, these partial derivatives are
computed by fitting splines through the points provided, and then taking
derivatives of splines.

These splines will pass through the points exactly when the smoothness
parameter of the surface is set to 0, and will be interpolated using natural
cubic splines, meaning that the curvature will be zero at the boundaries.
When the smoothness parameter is greater than zero, the surface
will be "relaxed" using the algorithm provided by SplineFitter, and will not
exactly pass through the points given, but will smoothly come close to the
points. The smoothness parameter can thus
be used to generate a surface that smoothly interpolates noisy surface data.

Here is a Wikipedia entry that describes the basic approach:

/** This is a two-argument Function built using a shared BicubicSurface and
managing current state to optimize for localized access. Each
distinct use of the BicubicSurface should create its own BicubicFunction,
which is a lightweight wrapper around the BicubicSurface. This allows for
localized access pattern optimization to be effective for each use of the
surface.

<h3>Thread safety</h3>
BicubicFunction is \e not thread-safe, but the underlying BicubicSurface is.
Each thread should thus have a private BicubicFunction that it uses to access
the shared surface.
