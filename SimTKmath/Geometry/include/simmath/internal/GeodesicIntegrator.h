/** This is a stripped-down numerical integrator for small ODE or DAE problems
whose size is known at compile time, with no provision for discrete variables,
event detection, or interpolation. You cannot use this integrator to advance
a Simbody System; see Integrator instead. Everything is defined in this header
file so that the integration can proceed with virtually no overhead. Templates
are used rather than run-time polymorphism, so there are no virtual function
calls. The system of equations is given as a template object that must
implement particular methods which the compiler may inline if they are simple
enough.

<h3>Class Equations</h3>
This integrator is instantiated with a class that encapsulates the system of
equations to be solved, and must provide compile time constants and methods
with the following signatures:
@code
class MyEquations {
public:
    enum { NQ=5,       // number of 2nd order equations
           NC=3,       // total number of position & velocity constraints
           N = 2*NQ }; // total number of states y

    // Calculate state derivatives ydot given time and state y.
    void calcDerivs(Real t, const Vec<N>& y, Vec<N>& ydot) const;

    // Calculate amount by which the given time and state y violate the
    // constraints and return the constraint errors in cerr.
    void calcConstraintErrors(Real t, const Vec<N>& y, Vec<NC>& cerr) const;

    // Given a time and state y, ensure that the state satisfies the constraints
    // to within the indicated absolute tolerance, by performing the shortest
    // (i.e. least squares) projection of the state back to the constraint
    // manifold. Return false if the desired tolerance cannot be achieved.
    // Otherwise (true return), a subsequent call to calcConstraintErrors()
    // would return each |cerr[i]|<=consTol.
    bool projectIfNeeded(Real consTol, Real t, Vec<N>& y) const;
};

@endcode

<h3>Usage</h3>

@code
// Create an object of a type that satisfies the Equations description above.
MyEquations eqns(...); // ... is whatever arguments you require.
// Instantiate an integrator for this system of equations and specify the
// integration accuracy and constraint tolerance.
GeodesicIntegrator<MyEquations> integ(eqns, accuracy, constraintTol);
// Initialize; will project constraints if necessary.
integ.initialize(t0, y0);
// Integrate to time finalTime, getting output every completed step.
while (true) {
    std::cout << "t=" << integ.getTime() << " y=" << integ.getY() << "\n";
    if (integ.getTime() == finalTime)
        break;
    integ.takeOneStep(finalTime);
}
@endcode

<h3>Mathematical Overview</h3>

This is an explicit, variable-step integrator solving a 2nd-order DAE
structured as an ODE-on-a-manifold system[1] like this:
<pre>
        (1)  udot = f(t,q,u)      NQ dynamic differential equations
        (2)  qdot = u             NQ kinematic differential equations
        (3)  0    = c(t,q,u)      NC constraints
</pre>
Here the "dot" suffix indicates differentiation with respect to the independent
variable t which we'll refer to as time here although it can be anything (for
geodesic calculations it is arc length). We'll
call the second order variables q the "position variables", and their time
derivatives u the "velocity variables". Collected together we call the state
y={q,u}. At the beginning of a step, we expect to have been given initial
conditions t0,q0,u0 such that |c(t0,q0,u0)|<=tol. The user provides the accuracy
requirement and constraint tolerance. We solve the system to that accuracy while
keeping the constraints within tolerance. The integrator returns after taking
a successful step which may involve trial evaluations that are retracted.

By "ODE on a manifold" we mean that the ODE (1,2) automatically satisfies the
condition that IF c==0, THEN cdot=0, where
<pre>
    cdot=Dc/Dt + Dc/Dq*qdot + Dc/Du*udot
</pre>
This means that satisfaction of the acceleration-level constraints is built
into the dynamic differential equations (1) so that we need only deal with
relatively slow drift of the solution away from the position and velocity
constraint manifolds.

To handle the constraint drift we use the method of coordinate projection and
expect the supplied Equations object to be able to perform a least-squares
projection of a state (q,u) to move it onto the constraint manifolds.
