//==============================================================================
/** A ContactGeometry object describes the shape of all or part of the boundary
of a solid object, for the purpose of modeling with Simbody physical 
effects that occur at the surface of that object, such as contact and 
wrapping forces. Surfaces may be finite or infinite (e.g. a halfspace). 
Surfaces may be smooth or discrete (polyhedral). Smooth surfaces are defined
implicitly as f(P)=0 (P=[px,py,pz]), and optionally may provide a surface
parameterization P=f(u,v). An implicit representation is valid for any P;
parametric representations may have limited validity, singular points, or may
be defined only in a local neighborhood.

A variety of operators are implemented by each specific surface type. Some of
these are designed to support efficient implementation of higher-level 
algorithms that deal in pairs of interacting objects, such as broad- and
narrow-phase contact and minimum-distance calculations.

The idea here is to collect all the important knowledge about a particular
kind of geometric shape in one place, adding operators as needed to support
new algorithms from time to time. 

All surfaces provide these operations:
  - find closest point to a given point
  - find intersection with a given ray
  - find most extreme point in a given direction
  - return the outward-facing surface normal at a point
  - generate a polygonal mesh that approximates the surface
  - return a unique integer id that may be used to quickly determine the 
    concrete type of a generic surface

Finite surfaces provide
  - a bounding sphere that encloses the entire surface
  - a bounding volume hierarchy with tight-fitting leaf nodes containing
    only simple primitives

Smooth surfaces provide
  - Min/max curvatures and directions
  - Calculate a geodesic between two points on the surface, or 
    starting at a point for a given direction and length

Individual surface types generally support additional operations that may
be used by specialized algorithms that know they are working with that 
particular kind of surface. For example, an algorithm for determining 
ellipsoid-halfspace contact is likely to take advantage of special properties
of both surfaces.

We do not require
detailed solid geometry, but neither can the surface be treated without some
information about the solid it bounds. For example, for contact we must know
which side of the surface is the "inside". However, we don't need a fully
consistent treatment of the solid; for ease of modeling we require only that
the surface behave properly in those locations at which it is evaluated at run
time. The required behavior may vary depending on the algorithm using it.

This is the base class for surface handles; user code will typically 
reference one of the local classes it defines instead for specific shapes. **/

We are given a guess at the closest point, and search only downhill from that
guess so we can't guarantee we actually are returning the globally closest.
However, the method does run very fast and is well suited to continuous 
tracking where nothing dramatic happens from call to call. 

If the line intersects the surface, we return the closest perpendicular point,
\e not one of the intersection points. The perpendicular point will be the
point of \e most separation rather than least. This behavior makes the 
signed separation distance a smooth function that passes through zero as the
line approaches, contacts, and penetrates the surface. We return that signed
distance as the \a height argument.

@param[in]  pointOnLine     Any point through which the line passes.
@param[in]  directionOfLine A unit vector giving the direction of the line.
@param[in]  startingGuessForClosestPoint
    A point on the implicit surface that is a good guess for the closest
    (or most deeply penetrated) point. 
@param[out] newClosestPointOnSurface
    This is the point of least distance to the line if the surface and line are
    separated; the point of most distance to the line if the line intersects
    the surface.
@param[out] closestPointOnLine
    The is the corresponding point on the line that is the closest (furthest)
    from \a newClosestPointOnSurface.
@param[out] height
    This is the signed height of the closest point on the line over the 
    surface tangent plane at \a newClosestPointOnSurface. This is positive 
    when \a closestPointOnLine is in the direction of the outward normal, 
    negative if it is in the opposite direction. If we successfully found the
    point we sought, a negative height means the extreme point on the line
    is inside the object bounded by this surface.

@returns \c true if it succeeds in finding a point that meets the criteria to
a strict tolerance. Otherwise the method has gotten stuck in a local minimum
meaning the initial guess wasn't good enough.

In case we fail to find a good point, we'll still return \e some points on the
surface and the line that reduced the error function. Sometimes those are
useful for visualizing what went wrong.

<h3>Theory</h3>
We are looking for a point P on the surface where a line N passing through P
parallel to the normal at P intersects the given line L and is perpendicular to
L there. Thus there are two degrees of freedom (location of P on the
surface), and there are two equations to solve. Let Q and R be the closest
approach points of the lines N and L respectively. We require that the following
two conditions hold:
  - lines N and L are perpendicular 
  - points Q and R are coincident

To be precise we solve the following nonlinear system of three equations:
<pre>
err(P) = 0
where
err(P) = [     n . l       ]
         [ (R-Q) . (n X l) ]
         [      f(P)       ]
In the above n is the unit normal vector at P, l is a unit vector aligned with
the query line L, and f(P) is the implicit surface function that keeps P on the
surface.

Gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures, Kg=k1*k2.
So for example, the Gaussian curvature anywhere on a sphere is 1/r^2. Note
that despite the name, Gaussian curvature has units of 1/length^2 rather than
curvature units of 1/length.

Harris' reference Struik 1961, Lectures on Classical Differential Geometry, 
2nd ed. republished by Dover 1988. Equation and page numbers below are from 
Struik.

This method works for any smooth surface for which there is a local (u,v) 
surface parameterization; it is not restricted to ellipsoids or convex shapes, 
and (u,v) must be distinct but do not have to be perpendicular. Both must be 
perpendicular to the surface normal.

First fundamental form:  I  = E du^2 + 2F dudv + G dv^2
<pre>   E = dxdu^2, F = ~dxdu * dxdv, G=dxdv^2  </pre>

Second fundamental form: II = e du^2 + 2f dudv + g dv^2
<pre>   e = - ~d2xdu2 * nn, f = - ~d2xdudv * nn, g = - ~d2xdv2 * nn </pre>

Given a direction t=dv/du, curvature k is
<pre>
         II   e + 2f t + g t^2
     k = -- = ----------------   (eq. 6-3)
         I    E + 2F t + G t^2
</pre>

We want minimum and maximum values for k to get principal curvatures. We can 
find those as the solutions to dk/dt=0.
<pre>   dk/dt = (E + 2Ft + Gt^2)(f+gt) - (e + 2ft + gt^2)(F+Gt) </pre>

When dk/dt=0, k =(f+gt)/(F+Gt) = (e+ft)/(E+Ft) (eq. 6-4). That provides a 
quadratic equation for the two values of t:
<pre>   A t^2 + B t + C = 0     </pre>
where A=Fg-Gf, B=Eg-Ge, C=Ef-Fe  (eq. 6-5a).

In case the u and v tangent directions are the min and max curvature directions
(on a sphere, for example), they must be perpendicular so F=f=0 (eq. 6-6). Then
the curvatures are ku = e/E and kv = g/G (eq. 6-8).

We're going to return principal curvatures kmax and kmin such that kmax >= kmin,
along with the perpendicular tangent unit directions dmax,dmin that are the 
corresponding principal curvature directions, oriented so that (dmax,dmin,nn) 
form a right-handed coordinate frame.

/** This utility method is useful for characterizing the relative geometry of
two locally-smooth surfaces in contact, in a way that is useful for later
application of Hertz compliant contact theory for generating forces. We assume
that contact points Q1 on surface1 and Q2 on surface2 have been determined with
the following properties:
    - the surface normals are aligned but opposite
    - points Q1 and Q2 are separated only along the normal (no tangential 
      separation)

Then the local regions near Q1 and Q2 may be fit with paraboloids P1 and P2
that have their origins at Q1 and Q2, and have the same normals and curvatures
at the origins as do the original surfaces. We will behave here as though
Q1 and Q2 are coincident in space at a point Q; imagine sliding them along
the normal until that happens. Now we define the equations of P1 and P2 in
terms of the maximum and minimum curvatures of surface1 and surface2 at Q:<pre>
    P1: -2z = kmax1 x1^2 + kmin1 y1^2
    P2:  2z = kmax2 x2^2 + kmin2 y2^2  
</pre>
Although the origin Q and z direction are shared, the x,y directions for the 
two paraboloids, though in the same plane z=0, are relatively rotated. Note
that the kmins might be negative; the surfaces do not have to be convex. 

For Hertz contact, we need to know the difference (relative) surface
between the two paraboloids. The difference is a paraboloid P with equation
<pre>
    P: -2z = kmax x^2 + kmin y^2
</pre>
It shares the origin Q and z direction (oriented as for P1), but has its
own principal directions x,y which are coplanar with x1,y1 and x2,y2 but
rotated into some unknown composite orientation. The purpose of this method
is to calculate kmax and kmin, and optionally (depending which signature you
call), x and y, the directions of maximum and minimum curvature (resp.). The
curvature directions are also the principal axes of the contact ellipse formed
by the deformed surfaces, so are necessary (for example) if you want to draw
that ellipse.

Cost is about 220 flops. If you don't need the curvature directions, call the
other overloaded signature which returns only kmax and kmin and takes only 
about 1/3 as long. 

@param[in]          R_SP1  
    The orientation of the P1 paraboloid's frame, expressed in some frame S 
    (typically the frame of the surface to which P1 is fixed). R_SP1.x() is 
    the direction of maximum curvature; y() is minimum curvature; z is the
    contact normal pointing away from surface 1.
@param[in]          k1      
    The maximum (k1[0]) and minimum (k1[1]) curvatures for P1 at the contact 
    point Q1 on surface1. Negative curvatures are handled correctly here but
    may cause trouble for your force model if the resulting contact is 
    conforming.
@param[in]          x2      
    The direction of maximum curvature for paraboloid P2. \a x2 must be in the 
    x1,y1 plane provided in \a R_SP1 and expressed in the S frame.
@param[in]          k2      
    The maximum (k2[0]) and minimum (k2[1]) curvatures for P2 at the contact 
    point Q2 on surface2. Negative curvatures are handled correctly here but
    may cause trouble for your force model if the resulting contact is 
    conforming.
@param[out]         R_SP    
    The orientation of the difference paraboloid P's frame, expressed in the

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
The handling of continuity here enforces our desire to have the length of a 
geodesic change smoothly as its end points move over the surface. This also
permits us to accelerate geodesic finding by using starting guesses that are
extrapolated from the previous result. If we find that the new geodesic has
changed length substantially from the previous one, we will flag the result
as uncertain and the caller should reduce the integration step size.

First, classify the previous geodesic G' as "direct" or "indirect". Direct 
means that both tangents tP' and tQ' are approximately aligned with the vector
r_PQ'. Note that as points P and Q get close together, as occurs prior to 
a cable liftoff, the geodesic between them always becomes direct and in fact 
just prior to liftoff it is the straight line from P to Q.

If G' was indirect, then G is the geodesic connecting P and Q that has tP 
closest to tP' and about the same length as G'. We use G' data to initialize
our computation of G and perform a local search to find the closest match.

If G' was direct, then we look at the direction of r_PQ. If it is still aligned
with the previous tP', then we calculate G from P to Q starting in direction
tP', with roughly length s'. If it is anti-aligned, P and Q have swapped
positions, presumably because they should have lifted off. In that case
we calculate G from P to Q in direction -tP', and report that the geodesic
has flipped. In that case you can consider the length s to be negative and
use the value of s as an event witness for liftoff events.

We are given points P and Q and choose
P' and Q' as the nearest downhill points on the surface to the given points. Then the
returned geodesic line runs from P' to Q'. The Geodesic object will contain only
the start and end points of the geodesic, with all the necessary information
filled in. The normals nP and nQ are calculated from the surface points P' and
Q'. The binormal direction is calculated using a preferred direction vector d
(see below) as bP=normalize(d X nP) and bQ=normalize(d X nQ). Then the tangents
are tP=nP X bP and tQ=nQ X bQ.

The preferred direction d is calculated as follows: if P' and Q' are 
numerically indistinguishable (as defined by 
Geo::Point::pointsAreNumericallyCoincident()), we'll use the given 
\a defaultDirection if there is one, otherwise d is an arbitrary 
perpendicular to nP. If P' and Q' are numerically distinguishable, we 
instead set d = normalize(Q-P). 

When P' and Q' are \e numerically coincident, we will shift both of them to
the midpoint (P'+Q')/2 so that the geodesic end points become \e exactly
coincident and the resulting geodesic has exactly zero length. There will
still be two points returned in the Geodesic object but they will be 
identical. **/

rectangle in the local x-y plane. Within the boundary, every (x,y) location has
a unique height z, so caves and overhangs cannot be represented.

The surface is parameterized as z=f(x,y) where x,y,z are measured in 
the surface's local coordinate frame. This can also be described as the

//==============================================================================
/** This ContactGeometry subclass represents an arbitrary shape described by a 
mesh of triangular faces. The mesh surface must satisfy the following 
requirements:
  - It must be closed, so that any point can unambiguously be classified as 
    either inside or outside.
  - It may not intersect itself anywhere, even at a single point.
  - It must be an oriented manifold.
  - The vertices for each face must be ordered counter-clockwise when viewed
    from the outside. That is, if v0, v1, and v2 are the locations of the 
    three vertices for a face, the cross product (v1-v0)%(v2-v0) must point 
    outward.
  - The length of every edge must be non-zero.

It is your responsibility to ensure that any mesh you create meets these 
requirements. The constructor will detect many incorrect meshes and signal them
by throwing an exception, but it is not guaranteed to detect all possible 
problems.  If a mesh fails to satisfy any of these requirements, the results of
calculations performed with it are undefined. For example, collisions involving
it might fail to be detected, or contact forces on it might be calculated 
incorrectly. **/
