  /** TaggedObject class.
   * Often, certain calculations or operations are expensive,
   * and it can be very inefficient to perform these calculations
   * again if the input to the calculation has not changed
   * since the result was last stored.
   * This base class provides an efficient mechanism to update
   * a tag, indicating that the object has changed.
   * Users of a TaggedObject class, need their own Tag data
   * member to keep track of the state of the TaggedObject, the
   * last time they performed a calculation. A basic use case for
   * users of a class inheriting off of TaggedObject follows like
   * this:
   *
   *  Initialize your own Tag to zero in constructor.
   *
   *
   *
   *  Before an expensive calculation,
   *      check if the TaggedObject has changed, passing in
   *      your own Tag, indicating the last time you used
   *      the object for the calculation. If it has changed,
   *      perform the calculation again, and store the result.
   *      If it has not changed, simply return the stored result.
   *
   *      Here is a simple example:
   \verbatim
          if (vector.HasChanged(my_vector_tag_)) {
            my_vector_tag_ = vector.GetTag();
            result = PerformExpensiveCalculation(vector);
            return result;
          }
          else {
            return result;
          }
   \endverbatim
   *
   * Objects derived from TaggedObject:
   *  Objects derived from TaggedObject must indicate that they have changed to
   *  the base class using the protected member function ObjectChanged(). For
   *  example, a Vector class, inside its own set method, MUST call
   *  ObjectChanged() to update the internally stored tag for comparison.
