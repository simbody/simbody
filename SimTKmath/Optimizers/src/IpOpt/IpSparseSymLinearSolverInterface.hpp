  /** Base class for interfaces to symmetric indefinite linear solvers
   *  for sparse matrices.
   *
   *  This defines the general interface to linear solvers for sparse
   *  symmetric indefinite matrices.  The matrices can be provided
   *  either in "triplet format" (like for Harwell's MA27 solver), or
   *  in compressed sparse row (CSR) format for the lower triangular
   *  part of the symmetric matrix.
   *
   *  The solver should be able to compute the interia of the matrix,
   *  or more specifically, the number of negative eigenvalues in the
   *  factorized matrix.
   *
   *  This interface is used by the calling objective in the following
   *  way:
   *
   *  1. The InitializeImpl method is called at the very beginning
   *  (for every optimization run), which allows the linear solver
   *  object to retrieve options given in the OptionsList (such as
   *  pivot tolerances etc).  At this point, some internal data can
   *  also be initialized.
   *
   *  2. The calling class calls MatrixFormat to find out which matrix
   *  representation the linear solver requires.  The possible options
   *  are Triplet_Format, as well as CSR_Format_0_Offset and
   *  CSR_Format_1_Offset.  The difference between the last two is
   *  that for CSR_Format_0_Offset the couning of the element position
   *  in the ia and ja arrays starts are 0 (C-style numbering),
   *  whereas for the other one it starts at 1 (Fortran-style
   *  numbering).
   *
   *  3. After this, the InitializeStructure method is called (once).
   *  Here, the structure of the matrix is provided.  If the linear
   *  solver requires a symbolic preprocessing phase that can be done
   *  without knowledge of the matrix element values, it can be done
   *  here.
   *
   *  4. The calling class will request an array for storing the
   *  actual values for a matrix using the GetValuesArrayPtr method.
   *  This array must be at least as large as the number of nonzeros
   *  in the matrix (as given to this class by the InitializeStructure
   *  method call).  After a call of this method, the calling class
   *  will fill this array with the actual values of the matrix.
   *
   *  5. Every time lateron, when actual solves of a linear system is
   *  requested, the calling class will call the MultiSolve to request
   *  the solve, possibly for mulitple right-hand sides.  The flag
   *  new_matrix then indicates if the values of the matrix have
   *  changed and if a factorization is required, or if an old
   *  factorization can be used to do the solve.
   *
   *  Note that the GetValuesArrayPtr method will be called before
   *  every call of MultiSolve with new_matrix=true, or before a
   *  renewed call of MultiSolve if the most previous return value was
   *  SYMSOLV_CALL_AGAIN.
   *
   *  6. The calling class might request with NumberOfNegEVals the
   *  number of the negative eigenvalues for the original matrix that
   *  were detected during the most recently performed factorization.
   *
   *  7. The calling class might ask the linear solver to increase the
   *  quality of the solution.  For example, if the linear solver uses
   *  a pivot tolerance, a larger value should be used for the next
   *  solve (which might require a refactorization).
   *
   *  8. Finally, when the destructor is called, the internal storage,
   *  also in the linear solver, should be released.
   *
   *  Note, if the matrix is given in triplet format, entries might be
   *  listed multiple times, in which case the corresponsing elements
   *  have to be added.
   *
   *  A note for warm starts: If the option
   *  "warm_start_same_structure" is specified with "yes", the
   *  algorithm assumes that a problem with the same sparsity
   *  structure is solved for a repeated time.  In that case, the
   *  linear solver might reuse information from the previous
   *  optimization.  See Ma27TSolverInterface for an example.
