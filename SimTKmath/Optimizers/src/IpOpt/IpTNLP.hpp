   *  and dense vectors.  This is the standard base class for all
   *  NLP's that use the standard triplet matrix form (as for Harwell
   *  routines) and dense vectors. The class TNLPAdapter then converts
   *  this interface to an interface that can be used directly by
   *  ipopt.
   *
   *  This interface presents the problem form:

   *     min f(x)
   *
   *     s.t. gL <= g(x) <= gU
   *
   *          xL <=  x   <= xU
   *
   *  In order to specify an equality constraint, set gL_i = gU_i =
   *  rhs.  The value that indicates "infinity" for the bounds
   *  (i.e. the variable or constraint has no lower bound (-infinity)
   *  or upper bound (+infinity)) is set through the option
   *  nlp_lower_bound_inf and nlp_upper_bound_inf.  To indicate that a
   *  variable has no upper or lower bound, set the bound to
   *  -ipopt_inf or +ipopt_inf respectively
