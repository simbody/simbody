  /** ReferencedObject class.
   * This is part of the implementation of an intrusive smart pointer
   * design. This class stores the reference count of all the smart
   * pointers that currently reference it. See the documentation for
   * the SmartPtr class for more details.
   *
   * A SmartPtr behaves much like a raw pointer, but manages the lifetime
   * of an object, deleting the object automatically. This class implements
   * a reference-counting, intrusive smart pointer design, where all
   * objects pointed to must inherit off of ReferencedObject, which
   * stores the reference count. Although this is intrusive (native types
   * and externally authored classes require wrappers to be referenced
   * by smart pointers), it is a safer design. A more detailed discussion of
   * these issues follows after the usage information.
   *
   * Usage Example:
   * Note: to use the SmartPtr, all objects to which you point MUST
   * inherit off of ReferencedObject.
   *
   * \verbatim
   *
   * In MyClass.hpp...
   *
   * #include "IpReferenced.hpp"

   * namespace Ipopt {
   *
   *  class MyClass : public ReferencedObject // must derive from ReferencedObject
   *    {
   *      ...
   *    }
   * } // namespace Ipopt
   *
   *
   * In my_usage.cpp...
   *
   * #include "IpSmartPtr.hpp"
   * #include "MyClass.hpp"
   *
   * void func(AnyObject& obj)
   *  {
   *    SmartPtr<MyClass> ptr_to_myclass = new MyClass(...);
   *    // ptr_to_myclass now points to a new MyClass,
   *    // and the reference count is 1
   *
   *    ...
   *
   *    obj.SetMyClass(ptr_to_myclass);
   *    // Here, let's assume that AnyObject uses a
   *    // SmartPtr<MyClass> internally here.
   *    // Now, both ptr_to_myclass and the internal
   *    // SmartPtr in obj point to the same MyClass object
   *    // and its reference count is 2.
   *
   *    ...
   *
   *    // No need to delete ptr_to_myclass, this
   *    // will be done automatically when the
   *    // reference count drops to zero.
   *
   *  }
   *
   * \endverbatim
   *
   * Other Notes:
   *  The SmartPtr implements both dereference operators -> & *.
   *  The SmartPtr does NOT implement a conversion operator to
   *    the raw pointer. Use the GetRawPtr() method when this
   *    is necessary. Make sure that the raw pointer is NOT
   *    deleted.
   *  The SmartPtr implements the comparison operators == & !=
   *    for a variety of types. Use these instead of
   *    \verbatim
   *    if (GetRawPtr(smrt_ptr) == ptr) // Don't use this
   *    \endverbatim
   * SmartPtr's, as currently implemented, do NOT handle circular references.
   *    For example: consider a higher level object using SmartPtrs to point to
   *    A and B, but A and B also point to each other (i.e. A has a SmartPtr
   *    to B and B has a SmartPtr to A). In this scenario, when the higher
   *    level object is finished with A and B, their reference counts will
   *    never drop to zero (since they reference each other) and they
   *    will not be deleted. This can be detected by memory leak tools like
   *    valgrind. If the circular reference is necessary, the problem can be
   *    overcome by a number of techniques:
   *
   *    1) A and B can have a method that "releases" each other, that is
   *        they set their internal SmartPtrs to NULL.
   *        \verbatim
   *        void AClass::ReleaseCircularReferences()
   *          {
   *          smart_ptr_to_B = NULL;
   *          }
   *        \endverbatim
   *        Then, the higher level class can call these methods before
   *        it is done using A & B.
   *
   *    2) Raw pointers can be used in A and B to reference each other.
   *        Here, an implicit assumption is made that the lifetime is
   *        controlled by the higher level object and that A and B will
   *        both exist in a controlled manner. Although this seems
   *        dangerous, in many situations, this type of referencing
   *        is very controlled and this is reasonably safe.
   *
   *    3) This SmartPtr class could be redesigned with the Weak/Strong
   *        design concept. Here, the SmartPtr is identified as being
   *        Strong (controls lifetime of the object) or Weak (merely
   *        referencing the object). The Strong SmartPtr increments
   *        (and decrements) the reference count in ReferencedObject
   *        but the Weak SmartPtr does not. In the example above,
   *        the higher level object would have Strong SmartPtrs to
   *        A and B, but A and B would have Weak SmartPtrs to each
   *        other. Then, when the higher level object was done with
   *        A and B, they would be deleted. The Weak SmartPtrs in A
   *        and B would not decrement the reference count and would,
   *        of course, not delete the object. This idea is very similar
   *        to item (2), where it is implied that the sequence of events
   *        is controlled such that A and B will not call anything using
   *        their pointers following the higher level delete (i.e. in
   *        their destructors!). This is somehow safer, however, because
   *        code can be written (however expensive) to perform run-time
   *        detection of this situation. For example, the ReferencedObject
   *        could store pointers to all Weak SmartPtrs that are referencing
   *        it and, in its destructor, tell these pointers that it is
   *        dying. They could then set themselves to NULL, or set an
   *        internal flag to detect usage past this point.
   *
   * Comments on Non-Intrusive Design:
   * In a non-intrusive design, the reference count is stored somewhere other
   * than the object being referenced. This means, unless the reference
   * counting pointer is the first referencer, it must get a pointer to the
   * referenced object from another smart pointer (so it has access to the
   * reference count location). In this non-intrusive design, if we are
   * pointing to an object with a smart pointer (or a number of smart
   * pointers), and we then give another smart pointer the address through
   * a RAW pointer, we will have two independent, AND INCORRECT, reference
   * counts. To avoid this pitfall, we use an intrusive reference counting
   * technique where the reference count is stored in the object being
   * referenced.
