   *  determine whether trial points are acceptable (e.g., based on a
   *  filter or other methods).
   *
   *  This backtracking line search knows of a restoration phase
   *  (which is called when the trial step size becomes too small or
   *  no search direction could be computed).  It also has the notion
   *  of a "soft restoration phase," which uses the regular steps but
   *  decides on the acceptability based on other measures than the
   *  regular ones (e.g., reduction of the PD error instead of
   *  acceptability to a filter mechanism).
