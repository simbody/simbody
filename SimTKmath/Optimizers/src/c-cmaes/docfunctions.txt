DOCUMENTATION (...not comprehensive but hopefully quite useful...)

First of all please spent 2-10 minutes to have a look at the files 

  cmaes_interface.h, and
  example_short.c, 

not necessarily in this ordering. 

Then, what follows is the more detailed documentation of the 
functions from cmaes_interface.h.  

double * 
cmaes_init_final(cmaes_t * evo_ptr);

    Input parameters: 
        evo_ptr: Pointer to CMA-ES struct cmaes_t that will be initialized 
                 within cmaes_init_final. evo_ptr->sp must have been
                 initialized using cmaes_init_para(evo_ptr, ...)
                 where the eclipses denote the same parameters as described
                 in cmaes_init(evo_ptr, ...) below.
  
    Details:
      This initializer allows to set values in cmaes_readpara_t evo_ptr->sp "manually"
      in the code instead of via the parameter file only. See cmaes_readpara_t type.
      
    Example:
      cmaes_t evo;
      double *arf;
      
      if (shortcase)
        arf = cmaes_init(&evo, ...);
      else {
        cmaes_init_para(&evo, ...);
        evo.sp.stopMaxIter = 1234;
        arf = cmaes_init_final(&evo);
      }

double * 
cmaes_init(cmaes_t * evo_ptr, int dimension , 
           double *initialX, double *initialStdDev,
	   long seed, int lambda, const char *input_parameter_filename);
void
cmaes_init_para(cmaes_t * evo_ptr, int dimension , 
           double *initialX, double *initialStdDev,
	   long seed, int lambda, const char *input_parameter_filename);

    DEFAULTS of input parameters (invoked by 0 or NULL respectively):
        dimension                : 0 /* no default available */
        initialX                 : [0.5,...,0.5]+Normal(0,initialStdDev^2), N-dimensional. 
        initialStdDev            : [0.3,...,0.3], N-dimensional vector. 
        seed                     : cmaes_random, see file actpar... 
        lambda                   : 4+(int)(3*log(N))
        input_parameter_filename : "cmaes_initials.par"

    Input parameters: 
        evo_ptr: Pointer to CMA-ES struct cmaes_t will be initialized 
                 within cmaes_init. When using cmaes_init_para, also
                 cmaes_init_final needs to be called before evo_ptr is
                 properly initialized. 

    Optional (default values invoked by zero): 
        dimension, int : Search space dimension N. Must be defined here
            or in the input parameter file. 

        initialX, double *: Initial point in search space. 

        initialStdDev, double * : double array of size dimension
            N. Coordinatewise initial standard deviation of the sample
            distribution (sigma*sqrt(C[i][i])==initialStdDev[i]). The 
            expected initial distance between initialX and the optimum per
            coordinate should be roughly initialStdDev. The entries should
            not differ by several orders of magnitude (see doc.txt).

        seed, int (randomly chosen by default): Random seed, written 
            to actparcmaes.par. 

        lambda, int : population size, number of sampled candidate 
            solutions per generation. 

        input_parameter_filename, char *: File which should be edited
            properly. Filename "no", "non" or "none" omits reading and 
            writing of any parameters in cmaes_init(), "writeonly" omits 
            reading but still writes used parameters to file "actparcmaes.par".

    Return, double *: array of size lambda==popsize that can be
             used to assign fitness values and pass them to
	     cmaes_UpdateDistribution(). 

    Details: The dimension has to be defined > 0 here or in the
        input parameter file ("cmaes_initials.par"). 

    CAVEAT: All input values are overwritten by values given in the parameter
        input file cmaes_initials.par. 

char *         
cmaes_SayHello(cmaes_t *): well, says hello, returns eg. 
                   "(5,10)-CMA-ES(mu_eff=3.4), Ver="1.00.00.beta", dimension=9"

void
cmaes_resume_distribution(cmaes_t *evo_ptr, char *filename):
    Input parameters: 
        evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

        filename: A file, that was written presumably by
            cmaes_WriteToFile(evo_ptr, "resume", filename).

      Details: Allows to restart with saved internal state (distribution) 
        variables (use cmaes_WriteToFile for saving). Keyword "resume" 
        followed by a filename in cmaes_initials.par invokes this function during
        initialization.  Searches in filename for the last occurrence
        of word "resume", followed by a dimension number, and reads the
        subsequent values for xmean, evolution paths ps and pc, sigma
        and covariance matrix.  Note that cmaes_init() needs to be 
        called before calling cmaes_resume_distribution()
        explicitely.  In the former all the remaining
        (strategy-)parameters are set. It can be useful to edit the
        written parameters, in particular to increase sigma, before
        resume. 

      Remarks: Not all internal state parameters are recovered. In
        particular generation number and xbestever are not restored. For
        covariance matrices with large condition numbers the writing
        precision of 6 digits is not sufficient and resume will lead
        to poor result.

void 
cmaes_exit(cmaes_t *) releases the dynamically allocated memory, 
		   including that of the return value of cmaes_init(). 


double *const*pop 
cmaes_SamplePopulation(cmaes_t *evo_ptr)
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

    Return, double **: A pointer to a "population" of lambda
        N-dimensional multivariate normally distributed samples.


double * const * x
cmaes_ReSampleSingle(cmaes_t evo_ptr, int index) 
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

      index, int: index to an element of the returned value 
         of cmaes_SamplePopulation, double **pop. pop[index] 
         will be resampled where 0<=index<cmaes_Get("lambda") 
	 must hold. 

    Return, double *: A pointer to the resampled "population".  

    Details: Can be called after cmaes_SamplePopulation to 
      resample single solutions of the population as often
      as desired. Useful to implement a box constraints (boundary) 
      handling. 


double * x
cmaes_SampleSingleInto(cmaes_t evo_ptr, double *x) 

    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 
      x, double *: Solution vector that gets sampled
         a new value. If x==NULL new memory is allocated
         and must be released by the user using free(x). 

    Return, double *: A pointer to the resampled solution
      vector, equals input x for x!=NULL on input. 

    Details: Can be called after cmaes_SamplePopulation to
      resample single solutions. In general, the function
      can be used to sample as many independent
      mean+sigma*Normal(0,C) distributed vectors as desired.

      Input x can be a pointer to an element of the vector
      returned by SamplePopulation(), double * const * pop,
      but this is inconsistent with the const qualifier
      of the returned value and therefore rather ReSampleSingle()
      should be used. 

    See also ReSampleSingle()


double * const x
cmaes_ReSampleSingle_old(cmaes_t evo_ptr, double *x) 

    Depreciated: use (redefined) ReSampleSingle() or 
         SampleSingleInto() 

    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 
      x, double const *: element of the return value of 
         cmaes_SamplePopulation, double **pop, that is 
         pop[0..len-1] where len=cmaes_Get("lambda"). 
         This solution vector of the population gets sampled
         a new value. 

    Return, double *: A pointer to the resampled "population" 
        member. 

    Details: Can be called after cmaes_SamplePopulation to 
      resample single solutions. In general,
      the function can be used to sample as many independent 
      mean+sigma*Normal(0,C) distributed vectors as desired. 

double * x
cmaes_PerturbSolutionInto(cmaes_t evo_ptr, double *x, double *x_in, double eps) 

    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 
      x, double *: Solution vector that gets sampled
         a new value. If x==NULL new memory is allocated
         and must be released by the user using free(x). 
      x_in, double *: mean vector for perturbation
      eps : scale factor for perturbation: 
            x \sim x_in + eps*sigma*Normal(0,C)

    Return, double *: A pointer to the perturbed solution
      vector, equals input x for x!=NULL. 

    Details: Used to reevaluate a slightly disturbed
       solution for an uncertaintly measurement. In
       case if x==NULL on input, the memory of the 
       returned x must be released. 

    See also SampleSingleInto()

double *
cmaes_UpdateDistribution(cmaes_t *, const double *rgFuncValue);
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

      rgFuncValue, const double *: An array of lambda function
            values. 

    Return, double *:  Mean value of the new distribution. 

    Details: Core procedure of the CMA-ES algorithm. Sets a new mean
        value and estimates the new covariance matrix and a new step
        size for the normal search distribution. 


void
cmaes_ReadSignals(cmaes_t *, char *filename)
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

      filename, const char *: by default "cmaes_signals.par" 

      Details: Reads commands from filename to stop the run
        or output data to the console or to a file. Uses function 
        cmaes_WriteToFile(), hence the same key sequences
        are available. See there and also file cmaes_signals.par for 
        more details. 

double 
cmaes_Get(cmaes_t *evo_ptr, const char *szKeyWord) 
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

      szKeyWord, const char *: keyword like "eval" for number of
         conducted function evaluations. 

    Return, double: the desired value. 

    Details: See implementation in cmaes.c for possible keywords. 

const double * 
cmaes_GetPtr(cmaes_t * evo_ptr, char const *keyword) 
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 

      keyword, const char *: keyword like "xbestever"
         the best ever evaluated solution vector or 
         "xmean" the current estimate for the optimum. 

    Return, const double *: pointer to the desired value array. 

    Details: Returns a pointer to the desired vector value 
      Its content might be overwritten during the next call to any
      of the cmaes_* functions other than cmaes_Get(). 
      See implementation in cmaes.c for possible keywords. 

double *       
cmaes_GetNew( cmaes_t * evo_prt, char const *keyword)
    Input parameters: see cmaes_GetPtr()

    Return, double *: pointer to the desired value array
         with unlimited reading and writing access to its
	 elements. 

    Details: The memory of the returned array must be 
         explicitly released using stdlib function free(). 

double *       
cmaes_GetInto( cmaes_t * evo_prt, char const *keyword, double *mem)
    Input parameters: 
          evo_ptr, keyword: see cmaes_GetPtr()

          mem, double*: memory of size N==dimension, where the 
               desired values are written into. For mem==NULL
               new memory is allocated as with calling
	       cmaes_GetNew() and must be released by the 
	       user at some point. 

    Return, double *: pointer to input parameter mem, 
             or the new memory, with the desired values. 

const char *   
cmaes_TestForTermination(cmaes_t *)

    Return value: NULL, if no stop criterion is satisfied. Otherwise a
        string with the stop condition description. 

    Details: Some stopping criteria can be set in cmaes_initials.par, 
        with names starting with stop... Internal stopping criteria 
        include a maximal condition number of about 10^15 for 
        the covariance matrix and situations where the numerical 
        discretisation error in x-space becomes noticeably. 

void
cmaes_WriteToFile(cmaes_t *evo_ptr, const char *szKeyWord,
                                 const char *szFileName); 
    Input parameters: 
      evo_ptr, cmaes_t *: Pointer to cma-es struct. 
            For evo_ptr==NULL the file is overwritten and
            szKeyWord is printed as header line. 

    Optional: 
           szKeyWord, const char *: There are quite a few keywords
               available. Most of them can be combined with a "+". See
               file cmaes_signals.par for examples and, in doubt, confer to
               the implemtation in cmaes.c. Keywords:

           "all": Writes a fairly complete status of the
               search. Missing is the actual random number generator
               status und the new coordinate system (matrix B).  
          
           "B": The complete basis B of normalized eigenvectors,
               sorted by the size of the corresponding eigenvalues.

           "eval": number of function evaluations so far. 

           "few" (default): writes in one row: number of function
               evaluations; function value of best point in recent 
               sample population; sigma; maximal standard deviation 
               in coordinate axis; minimal standard deviation in
               coordinate axis; axis ratio of mutation ellipsoid;
               minimum of diagonal of D. 

           "few(diag(D))": 4 to 6 sorted eigenvalue square roots, 
		 including the smallest and largest. 

           "resume": Writes internal state parameters for reading with
               cmaes_resume_distribution. For reading back also the
	       keyword resume in cmaes_initials.par can be used.

            further keywords: "dim", "funval", "N", "xbest",
                "xmean",...  See also implementation in cmaes.c and
		 the file cmaes_signals.par print and write keywords.

         szFileName, const char *: File name, default is "tmpcmaes.dat".

       Details: Useful combined keywords can be "eval+funval", "eval+few(diag(D))"
                "few+few(diag(D))", "all+B". The file cmaes_signals.par provides more
		examples as it uses the same syntax for writing and printing. 

void 
cmaes_UpdateEigensystem(cmaes_t *, int flgforce);
    Input parameters: 
        evo_ptr, cmaes_t: Pointer to CMA-ES struct cmaes_t will be initialized 
                 within cmaes_init

	flgforce, int: flag, for flgforce!=0 the eigendecomposion is conducted
                  even if eigenvector and values seem to be up to date. 

      Details: conducts the eigendecomposition of C into B and D
               such that C = B*D*D*B^T and B*B^T=I and D diagonal
               and positive. 

double *
cmaes_NewDouble(int n);

     Input parameters:
           n, int: size of double array to be allocated

     Return: allocated double array of size n, on error 
             the function cmaes_FATAL is called. 

  Details: the array should be released using function free(...); 

void
cmaes_FATAL(char const *s1, char const *s2, char const *s3, 
	    char const *s4)
     Input parameters: error messages, can be NULL. 

     Details: cmaes_FATAL writes error messages and terminates
             the execution by calling exit(1). This behavoir can 
             be modified.
